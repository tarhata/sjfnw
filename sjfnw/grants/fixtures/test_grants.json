Since that time, women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms.[37] Womanism[38][39] emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class.[35] Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless.[11] Third-world feminism is closely related to postcolonial feminism.[37] These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism,[40] Stiwanism,[41] negofeminism,[42] femalism, transnational feminism, and Africana womanism.[43]",

As part of the handshake between an SSL client and server, the server proves it has the private key by signing its certificate with public-key cryptography.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, anyone can generate their own certificate and private key, so a simple handshake doesn't prove anything about the server other than that the server knows the private key that matches the public key of the certificate. One way to solve this problem is to have the client have a set of one or more certificates it trusts. If the certificate is not in the set, the server is not to be trusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several downsides to this simple approach. Servers should be able to upgrade to stronger keys over time (\\\"key rotation\\\"), which replaces the public key in the certificate with a new one. Unfortunately, now the client app has to be updated due to what is essentially a server configuration change. This is especially problematic if the server is not under the app developer's control, for example if it is a third party web service. This approach also has issues if the app has to talk to arbitrary servers such as a web browser or email app.\", \"narrative5\": \"The Android system shows an on-screen keyboard known as a soft input method when a text field in your UI receives focus. To provide the best user experience, you can specify characteristics about the type of input you expect (such as whether it's a phone number or email address) and how the input method should behave (such as whether it performs auto-correct for spelling mistakes).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the on-screen input methods, Android also supports hardware keyboards, so it's important that your app optimize its user experience for interaction that might occur through an attached keyboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese topics and more are discussed in the following lessons.\", \"narrative6\": \"In this class you will learn to minimize the battery life impact of downloads and network connections, particularly in relation to the wireless radio.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis class demonstrates the best practices for scheduling and executing downloads using techniques such as caching, polling, and prefetching.

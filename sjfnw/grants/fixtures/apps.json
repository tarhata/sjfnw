    "narrative3": "Sara Ahmed argues that Black and Postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge \"to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought.\"[34] During much of its history, feminist movements and theoretical developments were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America.[35][36][37] However women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms.[36] This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms.[37] Womanism[38][39] emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class.[35] Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless.[11] Third-world feminism is closely related to postcolonial feminism.[37] These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism,[40] Stiwanism,[41] negofeminism,[42] femalism, transnational feminism, and Africana womanism.[43]",

The goals of the Coalition are to help schools decrease and respond to incidences of harassment and victimization and to better meet the needs of students who are perceived and/or identify as LGBTQQ (queer), as well as children of queer families.

    "narrative3": "The current climate for LGBTQ youth in Idaho is a hostile one and no other campaign or organization exists to support LGBTQ students. According to a 2003 Idaho survey, 43% of gay youth experience verbal harassment in school and in the 2007 Idaho State Legislative session, lawmakers tried to pass a bill requiring parental consent for students to join school clubs. The proposed legislation was a direct backlash to a failed effort by North Idaho students to establish a Gay/Straight Alliance (GSA) in a notoriously conservative community. \r\n\r\nIdaho is easily one of the most conservative states in the nation and for the past two decades, the Intermountain West has been the testing ground for divisive wedge issues and anti-gay attacks from fundamentalists. In 2006, a majority of Idaho\u2019s electorate approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and the amendment is among the most sweeping and destructive in the country, precluding any civil recognition for queer couples. The number of Idaho households with same-sex couples increased 73.3 percent in the past 10 years, according to new figures from the 2010 U.S. Census. Idaho posted the nation\u2019s sixth-largest percentage increase in same-sex households. \r\n\r\nFrom our Youth Night survey results, about 2/3 of our LGBTQ youth have experienced bullying in the last year and over 80% of youth hear homophobic comments in Idaho schools. Idaho also has tremendous barriers to organizing because the state is so vast and there are stark divides between rural and urban communities. In fact, many of Idaho\u2019s school districts are considered remote rather than rural. \r\n\r\nFor authentic, community-based outreach to occur in the schools, the Coalition focuses both on youth programs and training for the cadre of teachers throughout the state. Anti-LGBTQ student harassment is a well-established challenge in Idaho\u2019s schools, but teachers tell us they have no support in their building and youth tell us that those undermining a respectful climate are often educators and administrators. Through our work, we can break this isolation and fear with practical, proactive, youth- and teacher-driven conversations and tools. By equipping them with resources, tools and support we can help them become allies to LGBTQ students in the classroom and beyond. Because we take a systemic approach, we seek to develop programing that offers students, and teachers, counselors, and administrators a transformative experience that assist them in becoming powerful advocates for ours and future generations. \r\n\r\nThrough direct outreach, the Coalition provides advocacy for students and resources and skill-based training to educators. Currently, the Coalition participates in conferences throughout the state to help publicize its mission and resources and presents to many graduate classes, educators, social workers, and others to talk about the issues facing our LGBTQ community",

    "narrative4": "The Idaho Safe Schools Coalition will seek to continue our mission to advance school safety for Idaho\u2019s LGBTQ youth and their allies through a variety of statewide program delivery and specific community organizing strategies including:\r\nTargeted youth leadership development through training and relationship building;\r\n\r\nFurther support and development of Idaho school (college, Sr. high and Jr. high) GSAs and human rights clubs equipped with the necessary resources to address anti-LGBTQ sentiment with their peers, teachers and administrators; \r\n\r\nContinuation of our highly successful Youth Night for Treasure Valley teens led by a team of youth volunteers;\r\nOne community education event each year on the topic of LGBTQ youth for the public-at-large;\r\n\r\nImproving and enhancing current community-oriented programming to increase Coalition visibility and vision, and raise awareness and discussion around LGBTQQA issues; and,\r\n\r\nOrganize and assist ISSC\u2019s LGBTQQA youth and young adult membership in coalition building to work with area organizations working on statewide policy change in regard to state bullying laws and adding sexual orientation and gender identity to the Idaho Human Rights Act. \r\n\r\nDevelop and offer trainings to LGBT youth and support them by giving them resources they can use to form their own groups in their own communities.\r\n\r\nDevelop and offer trainings to the community as a whole; including specific trainings addressing the impact and implications of bullying in the classroom and beyond\r\n\r\nYouth will be included in evaluation of the Coalition\u2019s activities and as stated above, an intended outcome of our goals will be a sustainable and meaningful youth presence on the Coalition\u2019s committees. Finally, all youth engagement will be imbued with community organizing and leadership development principles. That is to say, it will be systemic, not token, and reflect a deep investment in skill building, multi-issue education, and long-term activism in the social justice movement. ", 
    "narrative5": "This year we worked in coalition with Add the Words, a group dedicated to expanding the Idaho Human Rights Act in Idaho by expanding it to include gender identity and sexual expression. After years of failing to get a print hearing, many were disillusioned by the process. Our goal working in partnership with ATW, The ACLU of Idaho, and United Vision for Idaho was to re energize activists. By bringing young people together with people who have experienced discrimination in their workplaces, who have been terminated or evicted because of their LGBTQ status or perceived status, we were able to start bridging the gaps between generations, get youth inspired to become part of a larger community, take up issues of advocacy that may not have directly affected them yet, and open up dialog about the systemic nature of oppression, and the power of community. Equally, it allowed older generations to glean a better understanding for what many are facing in schools today, and renewed their commitments to actively engage with youth, and for policies that protect all people within the LGBTQA community.\r\n\r\nThe ACLU of Idaho negotiated a settlement with the Boise School District after an incident of teacher on student bullying, which resulted in our development of a teacher workshop that we hope to make available to all districts across the state. The training is focused on the effect that bullying has on young people and the ramifications associated with LGBTQA bullying and harassment. ", 
    "narrative6": "Though, Idaho itself is not widely diversified, we strive to include all students. Of our five person board, our youth liaison is Latina, as is a member of youth advisory board. Both hail from Canyon County, which has a large Latino population, and is disproportionately poor in comparison to much of the state. Their roles are critical in allowing us to better understand the cultural barriers within these communities and develop programs that provide students from similar backgrounds advocacy and resources that they can use within their own communities.\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Safe Schools Coalition directs resources at approximately 20,000 teachers, students and families from diverse racial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.  The student organizations that the Coalition supports are also comprised of students with diverse backgrounds, including those of varying sexual orientations, gender identities, and race / ethnicities.  The Coalition is led by the executive committee, but most activities and funds  are allocated by a volunteer steering committee that includes area high school students, educators, parents, and other community members.  Currently, the Coalition has 10-15 LGBTQ students who attend monthly steering committee meetings and 20-25 student leaders from local high school GSAs, ensuring youth programming remains relevant and authentic. The Coalition prioritizes leadership development among LGBTQ and allied youth, people of color and transgender individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Human Rights Education Center, our fiscal sponsor works to promote respect for human dignity and diversity through education and to foster individual responsibility to work for justice and peace. The Center was founded in 1996 to construct a memorial to human rights and has grown to not only host thousands of visitors each year, but also has developed an active program of social justice. Their focus is on educational programs with teachers students, community leadership to promote advocacy of human rights.   270,000 visitors to the Anne Frank Memorial each year, which greatly increases our visibility and directly connects us with teachers from across the state.

    "narrative1": "Powder River was founded in 1973 by rural landowners in Northeast Wyoming working to protect their land, water and air from the ravages of coal strip mining. The organization played a leading role in the 1970\u2019s, securing passage of landmark state and federal coal mining regulations with passage of the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act and the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.  Our citizen-led efforts resulted in more effective coal mine permitting, bonding, reclamation and replacement of lost water wells. Our early work on regulating coal mining set the standards that continue to guide industry and government today. We worked with members of the Crow tribe to protect the pristine watershed of the upper Little Bighorn River from industrial development. We succeeded in getting the implementation of policies at the state and federal to address the impacts of coalbed methane development. We initiated higher oil and gas reclamation standards and increased bonding. Powder River was instrumental in Wyoming becoming one of the first states to make the fluids used in fracking of oil and gas open to the public. We have prevented the expansion of animal feeding factories through statute passage and enforcement of state regulations and been successful in getting state odor standards implemented and also been a leader in the evolution of country of origin labeling at both the state and national levels. We have forced the Nuclear Regulatory Agency into site specific EIS implementation for insitu  uranium mines and have enabled land owners to successfully negotiate to protect their rights concerning coalbed methane development through passage of state statutes and monitoring of programs. We were able to prevent the drilling of a gas well on National Forest land through the action of our members.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Problems:The regulatory authorities involved with oil and gas development have failed to adequately protect citizens and the environment and their lack of oversight has resulted in real and potential contamination of drinking water aquifers, the pollution of our air, and damage to our public and private lands.  The health of citizens living in development areas has deteriorated because of this failure. Extensive use of \u201cfracking\u201d combined with bad development practices and poor planning and oversight is threatening freshwater supplies and contamination at several sites in Wyoming. In addition, the flaring of gas, a waste product from new oil wells, is causing health and environmental problems to nearby citizens and properties. The explosion of deep oil and gas development throughout the state will lead to greater and more prevalent contamination if steps are not taken to regulate and reduce the impacts.\r\nRoot Causes: The continued reliance on fossil fuels for energy and the failure by the general population to be aware of not only the environmental problems caused by their development but also the immediate health impacts on people living near those developments. The insouciance of both federal and state government towards those impacted people has meant that they have received little acknowledgement or recompense.\r\nCollective Power: Powder River is often seen as the last resort to citizens and communities who have tried and failed to work their way through the government labyrinth. We bring people together from throughout the state to discuss their common problems and concerns and to work out strategies as to how to address them, what has worked and what hasn't. We reach out to other groups in other states facing the same problems. Our formal network in this is the Western Organization of Resource Councils.\r\nChange: At the national level our coordinated work with other groups is making a difference as the general public becomes more aware of the dangers of the new oil and gas plays. Here in Wyoming, which is an energy extraction dependent state, we are making progress. The state government is now paying more attention to the complaints of affected citizens because of the negative coverage by the press concerning energy development. The general public in Wyoming, although still pro energy development, are no longer thinking that Powder River is an outside interloper as our members have developed prominent voices that are listened to. The changes in public sentiment are slow but still there, Powder River sits on the Governors task force on energy policy, he recently asked for our input on water testing for planned  oil and gas development, and the state newspapers now call us a Wyoming conservation / landowner organization.",

We continue our work in Pavillion, keeping our members activated in the long drawn out process is a major effort. Our focus is on protection of public health and safety especially as it relates to air pollution from energy development, wise management of our current and future water supplies and protection of our land and habitat. We researched and published the report, \"A Seven Point Plan to Protect Groundwater During Unconventional Oil and Gas Development\", to highlight the issues. The Governor and his senior regulators met with our leaders and promised responses and action to our report. Other ongoing efforts include: 1) Continuing  to advocate for increased bonding and reclamation having achieved  some success through the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) ordering the revocation of bonds from companies failing to meet their reclamation and plugging responsibilities; 2) Legally challenging via the Wyoming Public Records Act the manner in which the WOGCC grants trade secret provisions for so called \u2018proprietary\u2019 chemicals used in fracking operations; 3) Raising the profile of impacts to ground and surface water aquifers from increased demands on water supplies for fracking and drilling and threats of contamination from improper disposal;  4)  Participating by invitation in the Governor\u2019s Energy Plan for the state which has also resulted in a separate plan for water resources; 5) Providing input to the Governor\u2019s staff on the development of baseline water testing near oil and gas drilling.\r\n\r\nAssessing objectives and goals: Our Board meets every two months and reviews what has been accomplished, resets our activities based on what has been done, and reorders our priorities based on what yet needs to be completed.",

The ESPC\u2019s programs fall into three areas: government accountability (open government, campaign finance reform, lobbyist reporting); tax and fiscal policy (mineral severance taxes, property taxes, tax breaks or incentives, economic diversification); and Wyoming working families (access to health care, minimum wage, gender wage gap, worker safety, quality child care).\r\nWe are also a founding member of the Western Organization of Resource Councils.

Currently two Powder River members sit on the Board of Directors of WORC, one representing the Board.\r\n\r\nWe help set the direction of both of these coalitions and work with them to make them successful. We cross a bunch of different lines bringing together progressives from rural areas. In the ESPC we collaborate with workers unions, people who work on domestic violence, church groups, etc. Bringing us together, sharing common beliefs and taking action on those beliefs means we are cementing relationships that can support each others values into the future and challenge the status quo.\r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Powder River does not actively seek to promote diversity.  Because of the independent manner in which we function, with no political affiliations, we do have quite a diverse membership considering the lack of diversity in Wyoming. Our Immediate Past Board Chair is Wilma Tope, who is a registered member of the Lakota Sioux tribe. A long serving board member is of Indian and Cambodian ancestry. Our Director spent 20 years working in development programs in Asia and is married to a Philippina. Our work, which centers on caring for our environment through citizen participation in decision making, promotes the acceptance of a diversified system and that the government is answerable to its citizens for the decisions it makes. We are definitely identified in Wyoming with supporting the common person  in his quest for recognition and recompense.  (Because of this we find it hard to find major donors in the wealthy class who, in this conservative state prefer to give their money to high profile brick and mortar or direct human services.)  What we have found is that the rural and urban working person receive little acceptance in the halls of governance.  Powder River has become a spokesman for those people.  We are trying to build a stronger relationship with the tribes on the Wind River Reservation.  We have made the most inroads with the Eastern Shoshone through Wes Martel who is vice-chairman of the Tribal Business Council and who was the keynote speaker at our Annual Meeting last year. We belong to the Equality State Policy Center (ESPC) which is a progressive Accountable Government organization of which we are a founding member. Wyoming Equality is a member of ESPC and it is through them that we address homophobia. This and racial justice are not issues we are active in; however the strength or our members to live and let live and to speak out on injustice when they see it is one of Powder River's strengths. There are probably few organizations that address racial justice in Wyoming and we have not had much of a chance to work with them, but working with the ESPC we are supporting those few groups that do.",

The water is of good quality in the aquifer, and it is actually used for consumption in the upper reaches, but Encana says that at a disposal depth of 15,000 feet they're basing their request on the fact that it's too hard to get to for public consumption even 100 years into the future. The two geologists on the five person Commission voted against the exemption.

At least that is how Powder River defines it. Citizens who bear the brunt of energy development, who sacrifice the health of their families because their air is polluted, their water contaminated, their lives completely turned around, etc. need to have their case put before the public and the decision makers. It does not matter what race or ethnicity or what your income is you should not be made to bear a completely unfair burden so that the rest of the citizens of the nation can enjoy the benefits of the very industry that has destroyed your way of live. There are many injustices in the world but the fact that the environment is being destroyed (and ignored) and that the very thing causing great harm to the environment is also ruining the lives of the people in that place. Oil and gas drilling using the new methods of horizontal drilling and fracking is causing greater harm than that industry ever did in the past, destroying aquifers and polluting the air through flaring. The people who live in those development areas are suffering so that the rest of us have cheap energy and neither the governments nor the general population are willing to give up that cheap energy and have therefore brushed aside the injustice being done. This is a human rights issue that needs to be addressed wherever corporate greed and, yes, individual citizen desires override morality and the need to do what is proper and good.",

HCAO\u2019s current goal is to pass health care legislation by building a strong statewide coalition and forming grassroots chapters.  \r\n\r\nHCAO was formed to pass Ballot Measure 23 (in 2002) to adopt a single payer health care system in Oregon.  Single payer means that there is one agency making the payments to private providers of health care; Medicare is an example. The insurance industry defeated the measure, spending millions of dollars on TV advertising. \r\n\r\nAfter a period of inactivity, HCAO joined other organizations to lobby a single payer bill in the 2011 Oregon legislative session.   We used the bill as an organizing tool and had a successful hearing and lobby day.\r\n\r\nIn December 2011, HCAO co-sponsored the statewide tour of organizers from the single payer movement in Vermont.  The tour held events in 11 towns around Oregon, attended by 1000 people, and kickstarted our statewide organizing.  Throughout 2012, HCAO worked to increase the number of its member organizations (currently 78).\r\n\r\nIn September 2012, HCAO hired its first staff person, a full-time organizer, whose task is to organize chapters throughout the state.  Otherwise, HCAO is an all-volunteer organization.\r\n \r\nHCAO is lobbying two bills in the 2013 session of the legislature, the single payer bill and a bill to have the state conduct a study of single payer and three other options and recommend the best option for financing universal health care in Oregon.  The study bill is currently enjoying broad bipartisan support, having passed out of committee unanimously, and passage is expected.\r\n\r\nWe are planning another ballot measure in 2016 and are laying the groundwork for a successful campaign by building our movement today.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The economic inequity that HCAO addresses is the lack of availability of health care for significant portions of the population, and the unaffordability of health insurance (which will continue under Obamacare), greatly affecting people\u2019s ability to work and their quality of life.  There are very large health disparities in the US, based on race and class, which are reflected in life expectancy, the frequency of chronic diseases, and incidence of injury. These economic, racial and class inequities produce extraordinary human suffering, exacerbated by the current health insurance system.  For example: \r\n\u2022\tIn the US, 62% of bankruptcies are caused by medical bills (Obamacare will not change this). \r\n\u2022\tIn the US, 44,789 deaths per year from treatable conditions are due to lack of comprehensive health insurance (Obamacare will only change this a little).  \r\n \r\nThe root causes of the problem are the reliance on the health insurance industry for health care administration and the power of the industry to block attempts at effective reform. Reliance on private insurance is responsible for the high cost of health insurance and its wastefulness.  Thirty-three percent of all health insurance premiums go toward profits or dividends, lobbying, CEO salaries, advertising, and overly complex administration. \r\n \r\nHCAO\u2019s goal is to revolutionize the health care system in Oregon with the adoption at the state level of a new law:\r\n\u2022         That covers everyone living or working in Oregon, \r\n\u2022         With comprehensive, high quality health care,\r\n\u2022         In which care is driven by the needs of the patients rather than by profits, and\r\n\u2022         That is publicly financed and minimizes administrative expenses and waste.\r\nIf the legislature does not pass a single payer bill, HCAO plans a ballot measure in 2016.\r\n \r\nTo achieve this formidable goal, we are conducting a massive organizing campaign to educate and mobilize the grassroots so that our politicians will pass the law despite the insurance industry\u2019s money and develop a movement that will gain enough strength to pass a 2016 ballot measure.  In doing so, HCAO brings people together to build collective power by organizing local chapters in every sizable town in Oregon.  Currently we have 36 local chapters: 19 are ongoing organizations and 17 are just getting started. Our goal is to have at least one chapter in every State House district with more in some districts, totaling 90.  The leadership of the current chapters is about 75% retirees and 25% students, workers, business owners, or unemployed people (mostly without insurance).  HCAO prioritizes the development of leadership skills in organizing chapters.  Our leadership trainings include education about health care issues, organizing your community (and speaking in public), recruiting others to join the movement, fundraising, basic media training, and inoculation against race-based attacks on the undocumented. \r\n",

A multi-year grassroots organizing and education program will be required in order to inform Oregonians about comprehensive health care systems and why a single payer system is the best option for covering everyone by utilizing the savings achieved from eliminating the insurance companies.\r\n \r\nHCAO\u2019s goals through 2016 are to conduct a statewide grassroots organizing campaign.  The steps (and how to assess them) are: \r\n\u2022         To strengthen the 36 HCAO chapters that have been started with at least one leadership development training in each chapter (assessed by growth in the number of volunteers and the activity level); \r\n\u2022         To add 40 additional chapters toward the ultimate goal of 90 chapters encompassing every State House district; \r\n\u2022         To increase diversity in leadership positions by 25% in one year; \r\n\u2022         To raise $100,000 in operational costs in 2013, increasing by 25% each year, and build a ballot measure campaign war chest; and \r\n\u2022         To continue to utilize and increase the number of volunteers, plus hire one full time fundraiser, and one additional organizer in 2013.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "HCAO is a coalition of 78 organizational members (including 15 chapters, described above).  We have succeeded in uniting health equity groups led by people of color with doctors and nurses, rural organizations, organized labor, small businesses, and community groups with the goal of building a massive statewide grassroots campaign to achieve universal access to health care in a system that covers all people living or working in Oregon.  Bringing together the diversity of interests involved in HCAO is the true strength and uniqueness of our movement.  Two of our Board members, representing CAUSA and CHARLA (Collective Health Advocacy & Rights of Latinos), are Hispanics who are deeply involved in the struggle for Latino and immigrant rights.\r\n \r\nHCAO participates in two coalitions: the HOPE Coalition and Allies for a Healthier Oregon.  We work with the HOPE Coalition on lobbying to support its health equity agenda on bills to create uniform standards for race, ethnicity, and language, cultural competency, and universal prenatal care.  HCAO provides HOPE with allies beyond the communities of color, primarily labor unions and rural groups.\r\n \r\nAllies for a Healthier Oregon brings together all the groups working on health care reform.  The participating organizations do not necessarily support a single payer system.  HCAO attends the meetings to share information, especially about what is going on at the legislature, and to advocate for the development of health policy that focuses on single payer health care financing, and not just delivery of health care (the reform issue most of the Allies focus on).\r\n \r\nAlthough both of these coalitions focus on health policy issues, HCAO plays an important role in building an effective progressive movement, especially with the Allies group, as an advocate for truly universal access to health care that includes everyone. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Disparities between whites and communities of color in rates of disease and health outcomes are well-documented, with communities of color having a higher incidence of chronic diseases, higher mortality rates, and poorer overall health outcomes.  In addition, access to health care is practically non-existent for undocumented people.  These disparities motivated HCAO to prioritize addressing inequality in access to health care in its Strategic Plan, its board structure, its lobbying (described in our answers to questions 1 and 5), and its statewide organizing.  In our Strategic Plan, one of HCAO\u2019s six principles is equity, and states that \u201cit is critical that HCAO work closely with organizations and representative groups to identify, recognize, and support the various issues of those struggling for health equity, such as culturally competent treatment, improved delivery in underserved communities, and serious attention to the social determinants of health.\u201d  Part of Goal 1 of the plan is to establish partnerships with health equity organizations and communities of color.  Another of HCAO\u2019s principles is universality, which states that \u201cAs a human right, health care must be accessible to everyone, without exception.\u201d  \r\nHCAO has made progress reaching these goals in several ways. The following organizations representing communities of color are members of HCAO: Oregon Latino Health Coalition, CAUSA, Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon (APANO), Center for Intercultural Organizing, Oregon Action, and CHARLA. The HCAO bylaws specify board positions for communities of color and communities facing significant barriers to health care.  These positions are currently filled by Reyna Lopez (CAUSA) and Sandra Hernandes (CHARLA).  We have been working closely with organizations of people of color at the legislature, particularly to eliminate disparities in health outcomes.  We are also working to build a multi-racial, multicultural grassroots movement through our member organizations and chapters.\r\n \r\nPart of our focus is to educate people about potential attacks especially about covering \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d We are teaching people how to rebut this argument.\r\nHCAO is a primarily white-led organization.  However, we are working to change this in many ways and we have succeeded already in becoming an ally of communities of color and people without insurance, through:\r\n\u2022         Our six basic principles including equity and universality\r\n\u2022         Our meaningful partnerships with health equity organizations\r\n\u2022         Our reserved seats on the board for people from communities of color and communities facing barriers to health care.\r\n \r\nSignificantly, all of the health equity organizations in Oregon are members of HCAO.  They recognize that HCAO is a coalition of many different types of groups, is a truly statewide grassroots organization, and is fundamentally dedicated to the inclusion of everyone in health care reform.\r\n \r\n\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "Lack of access to health care for significant portions of the population and the unaffordability of health insurance will continue under Obamacare. Even if a person is able to get health insurance, he/she can probably not afford the deductible (often $5-10,000 before insurance payments kick in).  So access to health care, a basic human right, is directly tied to one\u2019s income level.  \r\n\r\nLack of health care results in ill-health affecting people\u2019s ability to work and earn an income and has a major impact on quality of life.  Major health disparities in the US, based on race and class, result in lower life expectancy, higher infant and maternal mortality and increased frequency of chronic diseases and injuries. These economic, racial and class inequities produce extraordinary human suffering, exacerbated by the current health insurance system in which 33% of every insurance dollar does not go for patient care, but to insurance industry profits and administration.\r\n \r\nThe universal health care system advocated by HCAO will eliminate the role of the health insurance industry with its high costs and poor health outcomes, and in the process make it possible for Oregon to provide health care for every Oregonian without exception.  To achieve this formidable goal, a massive educational campaign and organizing effort at the grassroots level must take place so that people can advocate effectively for a single payer health care system and be inoculated against predictable misinformation from the insurance industry when we propose a ballot measure ensuring health care for all.  \r\n\r\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. expressed it well when he said \u201cOf all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.\u201d \r\n\r\nWithout access to affordable, comprehensive, equitable, publicly funded, high quality, universal health care economic justice cannot be achieved anywhere in the United States.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "NCBI Missoula creates a more just and inclusive society by developing leaders who work to end mistreatment, correct systemic inequalities and strengthen community cohesion.  NCBI envisions a community where the innate value of each person is respected, where members share a commitment to correct injustice, and where all people have the opportunity to thrive without risk of violence or oppression.\r\n\r\nThere are three pillars of NCBI\u2019s work: 1) Youth Development: engaging youth as social justice leaders; 2) Community Development: building community cohesion; and 3) Organizational Development: correcting systemic inequalities.  NCBI Missoula was established in 1998 in response to increasing incidents of racism and homophobia.\r\n\r\nNCBI is a multi-issue organization; rather than focusing exclusively on empowering women, or eradicating religious intolerance, we recognize the intersections between all forms of oppression. To end one, we must tackle them all. Having said that, over the years NCBI has responded to specific community needs with issue-based programs. NCBI offers a training model addressing classism, and an 8-week course designed specifically for white people to challenge and support one another in tackling racism. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, responding to needs brought forth by NCBI Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) members, NCBI launched Youth Forward, a support and action group for Queer and/or questioning youth.  While for many this group is the first time they felt safe to be themselves, others have launched significant and effective LGBT advocacy projects. Building confidence through support and mentoring is foundational to engagement in social change.  \r\n\r\nNCBI is a member of the National Safe Schools Roundtable and serves on the NSSR Advisory Committee. NCBI Additionally, NCBI is Montana\u2019s coordinator within the National Association of GSA Networks. These coalitions create a teaching/learning network for people working to change policies, develop curriculums, and create safer schools for LGBTQ students.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "NCBI is seeking funding to advance our initiative to support, mobilize and engage queer youth as leaders in tackling individual and institutional homophobia, and to build safer schools and communities. The impact of homophobia and heterosexism on queer youth is stark. Youth who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender are at a much greater risk of experiencing rejection from their families and peers and for alcohol and drug abuse. Shockingly, gay and lesbian youth make up over one-third of all teen suicides. While there are some fledgling PFFLAG chapters around the state and a handful of Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) in Montana high schools, prior to 2010 there were no formal support programs for queer youth in Montana. At best, many in the Rocky Mountain West lack experience and comfort talking openly about sexual identity and gender expression. At worst, anti-gay bias is largely normalized and condoned.\r\n\r\nAt the request of NCBI\u2019s Youth Advisory Council, NCBI created Youth Forward, a support and action group for LGBTQQ youth ages 14-18. In addition, through its Training of Trainers program, NCBI provides queer youth the opportunity to develop leadership skills and apply those skills in building safer schools. Since NCBI\u2019s start, queer and questioning youth have shared that NCBI youth programs are some of the only places they feel safe enough to be themselves. \r\n\r\nBuilding Collective Power: \r\nEmpowering youth leadership is a keystone of all NCBI youth programs, and Youth Forward is no different. The program was launched from a youth-adult partnership, youth named the group, select weekly topics, help facilitate group activities, and act as ambassadors for the group.  Youth Forward helps build a network of support to hold up youth who may be vulnerable, isolated and marginalized.\r\n\r\nNCBI\u2019s Youth Forward facilitators are recognized as leaders by their colleagues; other queer youth group facilitators throughout the region repeatedly turn to NCBI for support and guidance.  Youth Forward participants have risen to become active leaders, advocating for their LGBT community on issues ranging from gender-neutral bathrooms in their schools to federal non-discrimination legislation protecting LGBT students.\r\n\r\n\r\nNCBI\u2019s Impact\r\nYouth Forward participants are actively engaged in working to make their schools and state safer for their community, attracting national attention. Youth Forward members were invited to represent Montana at the  U.S. Department of Education\u2019s first LGBT Youth Summit in 2011, and the launch of Lady Gaga\u2019s Born this Way Foundation in 2012. \r\n\r\nBy implementing youth-driven, school-based violence-prevention and prejudice reduction, NCBI programs create safer, healthier and more inclusive schools and communities where all students can learn and thrive.  By empowering LGBT young people with leadership skills and violence prevention tools, NCBI is building collective power and creating change in Missoula and throughout the state.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "Health Care for All-Oregon\u2019s (HCAO) mission is to create a comprehensive, equitable, publicly funded, high quality, universal health care system serving everyone in Oregon.  HCAO\u2019s current goal is to pass health care legislation by building a strong statewide coalition and forming grassroots chapters.  \r\n\r\nHCAO was formed to pass Ballot Measure 23 (in 2002) to adopt a single payer health care system in Oregon.  Single payer means that there is one agency making the payments to private providers of health care; Medicare is an example. The insurance industry defeated the measure, spending millions of dollars on TV advertising. \r\n\r\nAfter a period of inactivity, HCAO joined other organizations to lobby a single payer bill in the 2011 Oregon legislative session.   We used the bill as an organizing tool and had a successful hearing and lobby day.\r\n\r\nIn December 2011, HCAO co-sponsored the statewide tour of organizers from the single payer movement in Vermont.  The tour held events in 11 towns around Oregon, attended by 1000 people, and kickstarted our statewide organizing.  Throughout 2012, HCAO worked to increase the number of its member organizations (currently 78).\r\n\r\nIn September 2012, HCAO hired its first staff person, a full-time organizer, whose task is to organize chapters throughout the state.  Otherwise, HCAO is an all-volunteer organization.\r\n \r\nHCAO is lobbying two bills in the 2013 session of the legislature, the single payer bill and a bill to have the state conduct a study of single payer and three other options and recommend the best option for financing universal health care in Oregon.  The study bill is currently enjoying broad bipartisan support, having passed out of committee unanimously, and passage is expected.\r\n\r\nWe are planning another ballot measure in 2016 and are laying the groundwork for a successful campaign by building our movement today.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The economic inequity that HCAO addresses is the lack of availability of health care for significant portions of the population, and the unaffordability of health insurance (which will continue under Obamacare), greatly affecting people\u2019s ability to work and their quality of life.  There are very large health disparities in the US, based on race and class, which are reflected in life expectancy, the frequency of chronic diseases, and incidence of injury. These economic, racial and class inequities produce extraordinary human suffering, exacerbated by the current health insurance system.  For example: \r\n\u2022\tIn the US, 62% of bankruptcies are caused by medical bills (Obamacare will not change this). \r\n\u2022\tIn the US, 44,789 deaths per year from treatable conditions are due to lack of comprehensive health insurance (Obamacare will only change this a little).  \r\n\r\nThe root causes of the problem are the reliance on the health insurance industry for administration of health care financing and the power of the industry to block attempts at effective reform. Reliance on private insurance is responsible for the high cost of health insurance and its wastefulness.  Thirty-three percent of all health insurance premiums go toward profits or dividends, lobbying, CEO salaries, advertising, and overly complex administration. \r\n\r\nHCAO\u2019s goal is to revolutionize the health care system in Oregon with the adoption at the state level of a new health care law:\r\n\u2022\tThat covers everyone living or working in Oregon, \r\n\u2022\tWith comprehensive, high quality health care,\r\n\u2022\tIn which care is driven by the needs of the patients rather than by profits, and\r\n\u2022\tThat is publicly financed and minimizes administrative expenses and waste.\r\nIf the legislature does not pass a single payer bill, HCAO plans a ballot measure in 2016.\r\n \r\nTo achieve this formidable goal, we are conducting a massive organizing campaign to educate and mobilize the grassroots so that our politicians will pass the law despite the insurance industry\u2019s money and develop a movement that will gain enough strength to pass a 2016 ballot measure.  In doing so, HCAO brings people together to build collective power by organizing local chapters in every sizable town in Oregon.  Currently we have 36 local chapters: 19 are ongoing organizations and 17 are just getting started. Our goal is to have at least one chapter in every State House district with more in some districts, totaling 90.  The leadership of the current chapters is about 75% retirees and 25% students, workers, business owners, or unemployed people (mostly without insurance).  HCAO prioritizes the development of leadership skills in organizing chapters.  Our leadership trainings include education about health care issues, organizing your community (and speaking in public), recruiting others to join the movement, fundraising, basic media training, and inoculation against race-based attacks on the undocumented. \r\n",

    "narrative4": "Most Oregonians with whom we interact are very confused about the current health care situation and seek reliable information about how Oregon should plan for its health care needs, what Obamacare will do, what Oregon\u2019s Coordinated Care Organizations will do, and whether we could or should guarantee health care to everyone in Oregon. \r\n\r\nFor comprehensive health care reform to succeed, the public will need to know that reform is not only possible, but realistic, cost effective and entirely consistent with American values of freedom, choice and responsibility.  A multi-year grassroots organizing and education program will be required in order to inform Oregonians about comprehensive health care systems and why a single payer system is the best option for covering everyone by utilizing the savings achieved from eliminating the insurance companies.\r\n\r\nHCAO\u2019s goals through 2016 are to conduct a statewide grassroots organizing campaign.  The steps (and how to assess them) are: \r\n\u2022\tTo strengthen the 36 HCAO chapters that have been started with at least one leadership development training in each chapter (assessed by growth in the number of volunteers and the activity level); \r\n\u2022\tTo add 40 additional chapters toward the ultimate goal of 90 chapters encompassing every State House district; \r\n\u2022\tTo increase diversity in leadership positions by 25% in one year; \r\n\u2022\tTo raise $100,000 in operational costs in 2013, increasing by 25% each year, and build a ballot measure campaign war chest; and \r\n\u2022\tTo continue to utilize and increase the number of volunteers, plus hire one full time fundraiser, and one additional organizer in 2013.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "HCAO is a coalition of 78 organizational members (including 15 chapters, described above).  We have succeeded in uniting health equity groups led by people of color with doctors and nurses, rural organizations, organized labor, small businesses, and community groups with the goal of building a massive statewide grassroots campaign to achieve universal access to health care in a system that covers all people living or working in Oregon.  Bringing together the diversity of interests involved in HCAO is the true strength and uniqueness of our movement.  Two of our Board members, representing CAUSA and CHARLA (Collective Health Advocacy & Rights of Latinos), are Hispanics who are deeply involved in the struggle for Latino and immigrant rights.\r\n\r\nHCAO participates in two coalitions: the HOPE Coalition and Allies for a Healthier Oregon.  We work with the HOPE Coalition on lobbying to support its health equity agenda on bills to create uniform standards for race, ethnicity, and language, cultural competency, and universal prenatal care.  HCAO provides HOPE with allies beyond the communities of color, primarily labor unions and rural groups.\r\n \r\nAllies for a Healthier Oregon brings together all the groups working on health care reform.  The participating organizations do not necessarily support a single payer system.  HCAO attends the meetings to share information, especially about what is going on at the legislature, and to advocate for the development of health policy that focuses on single payer health care financing, and not just delivery of health care (the reform issue most of the Allies focus on).\r\n\r\nAlthough both of these coalitions focus on health policy issues, HCAO plays an important role in building an effective progressive movement, especially with the Allies group, as an advocate for truly universal access to health care that includes everyone. \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Disparities between whites and communities of color in rates of disease and health outcomes are well-documented, with communities of color having a higher incidence of chronic diseases, higher mortality rates, and poorer overall health outcomes.  In addition, access to health care is practically non-existent for undocumented people.  These disparities motivated HCAO to prioritize addressing inequality in access to health care in its Strategic Plan, its board structure, its lobbying (described in our answers to questions 1 and 5), and its statewide organizing.  In our Strategic Plan, one of HCAO\u2019s six principles is equity, and states that \u201cit is critical that HCAO work closely with organizations and representative groups to identify, recognize, and support the various issues of those struggling for health equity, such as culturally competent treatment, improved delivery in underserved communities, and serious attention to the social determinants of health.\u201d  Part of Goal 1 of the plan is to establish partnerships with health equity organizations and communities of color.  Another of HCAO\u2019s principles is universality, which states that \u201cAs a human right, health care must be accessible to everyone, without exception.\u201d  \r\nHCAO has made progress reaching these goals in several ways. The following organizations representing communities of color are members of HCAO: Oregon Latino Health Coalition, CAUSA, Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon (APANO), Center for Intercultural Organizing, Oregon Action, and CHARLA. The HCAO bylaws specify board positions for communities of color and communities facing significant barriers to health care.  These positions are currently filled by Reyna Lopez (CAUSA) and Sandra Hernandes (CHARLA).  We have been working closely with organizations of people of color at the legislature, particularly to eliminate disparities in health outcomes.  We are also working to build a multi-racial, multicultural grassroots movement through our member organizations and chapters.\r\n\r\nPart of our focus is to educate people about potential attacks especially about covering \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d We are teaching people how to rebut this argument.\r\nHCAO is a primarily white-led organization.  However, we are working to change this in many ways and we have succeeded already in becoming an ally of communities of color and people without insurance, through:\r\n\u2022\tOur six basic principles including equity and universality\r\n\u2022\tOur meaningful partnerships with health equity organizations\r\n\u2022\tOur reserved seats on the board for people from communities of color and communities facing barriers to health care.\r\n\r\nSignificantly, all of the health equity organizations in Oregon are members of HCAO.  They recognize that HCAO is a coalition of many different types of groups, is a truly statewide grassroots organization, and is fundamentally dedicated to the inclusion of everyone in health care reform.\r\n\r\n",

In Washington and Payette Counties, the air, land, water and public health are being compromised by oil and gas companies with the area\u2019s emerging hydraulic fracturing industry.  The Weiser River Resource Council is conducting a public education campaign to educate landowners about their rights when it comes to leasing their minerals, and organizing affected people to work together to change the rules and regulations that have permitted irresponsible natural gas development in their own backyards. \r\n\r\nGoal 2:  Establish the infrastructure for a new state-wide grassroots organization in Idaho. IORC\u2019s Statewide Steering Committee will build into a new rural-focused, multi-issue, membership-based and democratically-controlled citizens\u2019 organization in Idaho. IORC will eventually become an official organization of the Western Organization of Resource Councils. \r\n\r\nGoal 3: Expand the state organization across Idaho. IORC will increase its capacity by building additional chapters in rural areas. Organizing assessments are conducted through direct, one-on-one outreach to potential leaders and activists with the objective of assessing their interest in and getting them engaged in critical issues that affect their communities.  \r\n\r\nGoal 4: Train and develop new and existing leaders. IORC is recruiting and training Idaho leaders to participate in local and regional trainings to increasing their leadership skills and further engage them in issue campaigns. By continuing to develop our leaders, we are building a strong base for IORC to succeed in the long term. \r\n\r\nProgress will be evaluated through meetings and conference calls of the Idaho Organizing Team and the Steering Committee. An immediate indicator of success is the infusion of energy and resources into building a rural partner that can work for wealth creation and poverty elimination within the community of groups and interests in the state. \r\n",

WORC does not have specific policies on racial justice, but these values are expressed in both how we manage and govern our organization and in our activities. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the WORC Education Project is incubating and spinning off a new progressive, non-partisan Native American civic engagement organization: Western Native Voice (WNV). WNV is empowering Native American people to engage in civic life, first in Montana, and then to each Western state with significant Native American populations. WORC staff is providing strategic and fundraising support as Western Native Voice builds and grows. WNV is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of Native American leaders. At its founding meeting in August 2011, the Board set the following goals for the organization.\r\n\u2022\tAmplify the voice of Native American people through increased voter registration, turnout and participation in all aspects of civic life.\r\n\u2022\tEstablish a permanent, non-partisan civic engagement infrastructure for Native Americans living within the West\u2019s reservations and major cities.\r\n\u2022\tStrengthen Native American leadership capacity and involvement at tribal, local, state and national levels.\r\n\u2022\tOrganize for and advocate progressive policies that improve the health and well-being of Native Americans and that safeguard their fundamental goals.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "Thirty seven percent of Idahoans live in rural areas. Including small \u201ccommuter\u201d counties around metropolitan Boise, this number rises to 42%. Idaho is geographically large with several distinct regions. Unlike other states, no successful policy can advance politically in Idaho if it fails to address this fundamental fact. Solutions that focus solely on metropolitan Boise also leave hundreds of thousands of Idahoans behind. Poverty and economic justice issues hit harder in rural Idaho. Poverty and unemployment rates are higher in rural communities. New, diverse job opportunities are fewer. Rural Idahoans are older, less education and less able to take advantage of those new opportunities. Rural areas have a general lack of access to public services. Distance and transportation become major issues for the rural poor. In addition, traditionally disadvantaged populations\u2014including Hispanics and Native Americans\u2014also make their homes in rural Idaho.\r\n\r\nWe believe that any effort to address the issue of poverty and create wealth in Idaho must include a strong rural component. It must also focus heavily on creating local wealth through the food and energy sector\u2014an effort we call Homegrown Prosperity. This vision will be advanced by policies that emphasize local ownership and small independent entrepreneurs in the business of clean energy and local food. This promises more income retained in local economies, healthier and more vibrant social institutions, such as schools, and improved opportunities for heightened community quality of life including clean air and water and sustainable living wage jobs. It is our focus to generate wealth at the community level improving the lives of rural residents in all communities. No grassroots, membership based organization in Idaho is focused on addressing rural issues or on creating Homegrown Prosperity. We are proposing to fill this gap by building such an organization. \r\n",

    "narrative1": "The Owe Aku International Justice Project (\u201cIJP\u201d) was formed by Lakota people based on the principles taught to us by our ancestors utilizing ancient forms of social organization, individual responsibility and commitment to the tiyospaye.  I don't have enough words to define the Lakota words.\r\n\r\n1.  Since March we have completed  trainings on the Pine Ridge Homeland, on the Ponca homeland in Oklahoma, and one in Yankton, a Dakota reservation, in collective action with Great Plains Tarsands Resistance and Tarsands Blockade.  We have had two planning meetings for gathering on other Lakota reservations and with our allis.   \r\n\r\n3.  Owe Aku was able to work with inter-tribal officials, our traditional treaty councils, Native communities and Red Nations to organize educational, collaborative events for tribal government.  In addition, the recently elected President of the Oglala Sioux Nation Tribal Council (Pine Ridge) has been very supportive of our efforts and we are acting in an advisory or consultative role to his administration.  \r\n\r\n4.  Several Lakota women\u2019s gatherings were held on Lakota territory renewing alliances amongst our own people of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota nations as well as with long time allies in the Indigenous environmental movement.  Known as Winyan Ituwan (dream of the women) women\u2019s gatherings are a critical aspect of the traditional Lakota decision-making process and have guided us in many of our activities.  \r\n\r\n5.  One of the reasons that Moccasins on the Ground was so successful was the increasing urgency of this coming disaster for sacred water and Unci Maca.  We attract diverse groups and many of our neighbors whose land and livelihood will also be adversely affected by the contamination of our Sacred Water.  As a result we  helped establish the Cowboy & Indian Alliance (which is exactly what it sounds like) to oppose the Pipeline. \r\n",

Throughout 2012 we established a series of events and reached out to build alliances with other Red Nations as well as non-Natives whose lives will be as adversely affected as Indian peoples.  \r\n\r\nIn the Lakota Language Owe Aku means Bring Back the Way.  In bringing back the way, we strive to offer alternatives, based on traditional knowledge, that respects the changing environmental conditions of Mother Earth, and which will ultimately benefit the peoples and ecosystems of the planet.  On every continent Indigenous cultures are anxious to share viable alternatives because we recognize the Earth, not as a commodity to be exploited, but as a relative that protects and preserves our very existence and the existence of future human generations.

    "narrative3": "Owe Aku works to reverse the devastation caused by genocide, colonization, decades of purposeful starvation, theft of our lands,  unilateral abrogation of internationally binding treaties, the violent extraction of our language and spirituality through use of the \"law\" and the kidnapping of our children by Christian Americans who then deported them to boarding schools for at least five generations, the mass extermination of our \"closest relative\" the buffalo and now, most recently, the devastating effects of unbridled consumerism feeding the insatiable desires of a corporate culture that has no respect for nature and makes war around the world in order to preserve its pretense of wealth.  The root causes of these problems are the American colonial culture unwilling to accept its own responsibility in historic and contemporary genocide, ehtnocide and ecocide.  The atrocities or \"root causes\" are too numerable to discuss here.  Nonetheless, our culture has always been collective and the only way we have survived has been to rely upon the 'collective power' you mention.  Today many Lakota communities are thriving because of a return to the practices of our collective power, part of the foundation involved in the project for which we are requesting funding.\r\n\r\nDebra White Plume said it best:  Our goal is to be left alone, to live in peace on our land and to preserve our culture while continuing to be good relatives and neighbors.\r\n\r\nAs just stated, the most important goal for both our own people and those with whom we are making alliances is the preservation of a way of life based on balance and respect.  One of our non-Indigenous allies expressed this very well:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe all have indigenous ancestors.\u00a0 The wisdom of our indigenous ancestors exists in the depth of our souls. \u00a0Perhaps the earth and our ancestors are trying to reconnect us with that wisdom every day.\u00a0 In focusing on a particular community on a very particular land, being guided by a very particular heritage of earth wisdom, Owe Aku is showing us the way by living it.\u00a0 So the rest of us can live it, bring back OUR way, our connection to particular communities, the teachings of our particular land, of our particular ancestors.\u00a0 We may not consciously know that is what guides us, but Owe Aku speaks to that wisdom in us so we can reconnect with it.\u201d  (Medora Woods, Philanthropist and Ally of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Movements)\r\n\r\nThis is not simply a philosophy.  We are literally continuing to build this community, a process to which Owe Aku has dedicated our lives and one which serves, as intended, as the basis from which we must operate.  ",

So far we have been to Yankton (Dakota Nation) and Cheyenne River.  We have laid the ground work for further gatherings at Cheyenne River, Rosebud, Yankton and Santee.  \r\n\r\nWe are currently working with allies to organize action camps on our territories to train young activists from all across North America on the sacred water protection work, as well as direct action training.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to work with inter-tribal officials as well as the new President of the Pine Ridge Tribal Council, allying our traditional and federal leadership. We will continue to host Winyan Ituwan gatherings (The Vision of the Women).  \r\n\r\nWe are participating, with our Pine Ridge youth, in the design and implementation of the Lakota Media Project so that our people tell our story.   \r\n\r\nDecisions are always made collectively first with the grassroots leaders of our tiyospaye and our direct allies.  The people of our tiyospaye founded Owe Aku Bring Back the Way and have continued to direct its activities and make decisions based on the traditional Lakota principle of consensus.  We are accountable to the community and to our leadership.  Owe Aku meets with tribal officials to both educate and report.  We also report to the Black Hills Sioux Nation Treaty Council, the traditional governing authority of the Lakota Oyate.  Through our process of accountability, the Treaty Council passed its own resolution protecting sacred water and in opposition to the XL Pipeline.

However, we believe the majority realizes this and pray that this time, President Obama will live up to his commitments and responsibilities.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Fighting oppression is a part of our DNA.  Owe Aku is responsible for carrying out all of the plans and projects stated within this proposal because we have generations of experience fighting the ravages of domination, racial injustice (Native Americans are 100 times more likely to be arrested than African Americans), the resulting poverty (Pine Ridge has an unemployment rate that has always hovered somewhere between 80 and 90 percent and the South Dakota County colonizing the reservation is the poorest or second poorest in nearly every census) and environmental racism (our ground water is so contaminated from 60 years of uninterrupted uranium mining that water has to be piped from the Missouri River to an area with one of the wold's largest and most contaminated aquifers - the same aquifer that irrigates the food you eat).  The core group of decision makers from Owe Aku reside on the reservation and most were raised in the American Indian Movement having witnessed the results of racial injustice since childhood.  Debra White Plume has been involved in this work since her teens.  She has degrees in western science and language and decades of grass roots experience.  She is a descendant of the Red Cloud tiyospaye and a granddaughter to the current leader of the Seven Council Fires of the Lakota Nation, also Chief Red Cloud.  Debra White Plume speaks Lakota.  Alexander White Plume is the NaCha (or head of the traditional tiyospaye) that founded Owe Aku.  He is a descendant of the same tiyospaye as Crazy Horse and is a fluent Lakota speaker.  The vast majority of Owe Aku\u2019s decision making process relies upon our language for guidance, an integral part of the decision-making process.  Several other members of the tiyospaye are knowledgeable in the songs, ceremonies and traditions of our culture, from which we receive guidance on our work.  Another of our people has worked in the two-spirit community and is in fact working on an international conference confronting settler colonialism and sexuality.    \r\n\r\nAdditionally, our decision makers include experts on tribal processes, federal Indian law, international law, environmentalism, extraction processes, communications, documentary film-making, graphic arts, and writing. Our extended tiyospaye is diverse in its representation of urban, rural, gay, strait, disabled and individuals from different generations.  One of our White allies was shocked to find that entire families often involving three or four generations attended our gatherings and meetings.  We also come from other Native nations, non-governmental organizations, philanthropists and domestic and international legal experts.  Women make up more than half of the core group involved in the decision making process and under traditional Lakota law, women are responsible for any decisions involving conflicts with other nations or peoples.  \r\n",

Through the making of relatives (which is a ceremony of the Lakota culture) and allies (in fact, Lakota means allies) our contribution to systemic change demonstrates the critical need for collective action.  Currently, in the United States of America, the word \"collective\" is anathema, but we will not surrender to a destructive world view and will continue to build a movement led by collective decision-making and action.  \r\n\r\nWe see the work that we are doing as one aspect of the many interconnected pursuits of our people contributing to the preservation of a way of life that honors the Earth and, in honoring the Earth, protects future generations.  We strive to simply be good relatives. The result is environmental justice.",

Over the past decade, we have responded to and successfully defeated several anti-immigrant and discriminatory policies throughout Oregon. Because of the success of our organizing model, in more recent years, Causa has taken an offensive position in our political advocacy work and has begun to set the tone for how policies impacting Latinos and immigrant groups in Oregon are decided. \r\n\r\nOver the past five years, we have deepened our impact across the region substantially; in just a few years, our operating budget has grown from $300,000 to well over $800,000 and the number of people we have reached has more than quadrupled. To date, we are the largest Latino immigrant rights organization in the Pacific Northwest and among the top twelve largest in the country. \r\n\r\nThis year at Causa has already been a monumental one. In just over four months, we have made history on a series of policy fronts: with our allies, we successfully advocated for the passage of tuition equity and the reinstatement of driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented individuals in Oregon in addition to working with the Multnomah County Sherriff to begin releasing undocumented immigrants brought to his jails for low-level crimes such as non-violent misdemeanors. We were also part of the campaign for Earned Paid Sick Days in Portland, which was unanimously voted into law by Portland\u2019s City Council.

    "narrative3": "Causa focuses on changing systems of oppression that affect immigrants in the U.S. by influencing policy on a local, state and national level. We invest in developing the leadership skills of our community so that our voices are heard and that we are aptly represented in society. We also promote civic engagement so that our community is informed and empowered to exercise their right to engage in the democratic process. \r\n\r\nCausa has become increasingly sensitive to the fact that the Latino immigrant community is not monolithic, but rather comprised of a diverse mix of people with their own unique life stories, traditions, languages and beliefs. Thus, Causa founded the LGBTQ Alliance Building Program in 2010 to intentionally integrate LGBTQ issues into our organization\u2019s core mission, work plan and goals. Since then, we have made remarkable strides in advancing the Program\u2019s two principle goals: 1) supporting the leadership of LGBTQ Latinas, Latinos, and immigrants to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed and 2) educating the broader Latino community about LGBTQ issues and building a broader base of support.\r\n\r\nThe LGBTQ Latino immigrant community faces major barriers to integration both within the family and within the Latino community at large. LGBTQ issues are not broadly discussed or understood within our community and LGBTQ Latino immigrants often face discrimination, stigma, fear and isolation. Furthermore, established LGBTQ organizations in Oregon have not traditionally provided programming that adequately serves the needs of LGBTQ Latino immigrants. For example, while programs do exist that address racial diversity, these programs have only been provided in English and have not taken into account the various cultural and linguistic barriers that various LGBTQ immigrant communities might face. \r\n\r\nRoot causes of the above issues include: systems of oppression that treat members of our community unequally because of their immigration status, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation and/or gender identity.\r\n\r\nCausa builds collective power by intentionally creating alliances across sectors and communities. For example, this year we effectively reached out to the business, agriculture, labor, LGBTQ, education, public health and faith communities to pass both tuition equity and the reinstatement of driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented individuals. We were successful because we found common ground and were willing to compromise in order to advance our shared agendas and create meaningful change that would not have been possible in isolation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed initiative will not single-handedly tackle the root causes of oppression facing the LGBTQ Latino immigrant community, but it will ignite new conversations and support Causa\u2019s overall goal of integrating LGBTQ Latino immigrants and those who are LGBTQ inclusive into our broader political organizing agenda.",

This lifted up the unique challenges faced by LGBTQ immigrants, and has supported LGBTQ Latino and Latina leadership in the community and within Causa.  This approach has more accurately represented the depth and breadth of our communities, and has addressed the oppressions faced at the intersections of identities. We are also working diligently to externalize our work for LGBTQ Latino immigrant equality, pushing the work out into our base and broader community. We incorporated LGBTQ issues into our May Day march (with over 4,000 people in attendance) leadership classes, public organizational materials, public events, and convened an organizing group for Latinos, Latinas, and allies in Salem and Portland. Through the expansion of the Radio Initiative, we now seek to broaden this work by intentionally including the LGBTQ Latino immigrant community in our organizing in Central Oregon to make sure national comprehensive immigration reform becomes a reality this year and that people are informed as the process unfolds.

Working closely with incarcerated Native Americans, we experienced firsthand the \u2018revolving door\u2019 known as recidivism. Inmates would confide in us, \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to go, I don\u2019t know what I will do.\u201d In February 2006 we formed a Board of Directors and began the process of crafting our mission and purpose: To prevent incarceration of Native Americans and provide assistance to incarcerated Native Americans who are proactively working toward creating a better life for themselves, their children, and their communities. Upon receiving non-profit status in 2007, we have continuously worked to promote and develop culturally competent pre and post incarceration programs which aid in prevention, responsibility, respect and empowerment of individuals, families and communities.  \r\n\r\nThe heart of our organization is our volunteer base, which has grown to over 70 community members. With their unwavering support, RLTS is gaining recognition within the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) administration and Native communities as a strong voice for incarcerated Native people. We are proud of our core prison programs, which have expanded and been refined over the last year in order to improve outcomes and serve more individuals. Yet, RLTS\u2019s major accomplishment is that the effects of RLTS can now \u2014and will continue to\u2014 be seen throughout the community.

If I hadn\u2019t come to prison, I would never have seen a model of strong, responsible, respectful women.\u201d RLTS client.\r\n\r\nRLTS believes the high disparity levels of intergenerational incarceration among Native Americans is directly related to repeated historical traumas, violence, poverty, and substance abuse experienced and passed down through the generations. Historical trauma has been described as \u201cthe distress and suffering resulting from numerous compounding historically traumatic events experienced by a community over several generations\u201d (Yellow Horse Brave Heart, 1996). \r\n\r\nThe root causes of Native American incarceration, substance abuse addiction and parenting problems lie within the historical trauma that our culture has endured, including:\r\n\u2022\tA legacy of genocide so horrendous that it caused deep intergenerational trauma\u2014separating Indigenous people from their cultures, languages, traditions and families.\r\n\u2022\tA trauma of this magnitude often manifests as violence and addictions, and leads to involvement with the criminal justice system\u2014Incarceration is intergenerational.\r\n\u2022\tA culture of widely held stereotypes regarding Native people, as well as incarcerated people, that discourage compassion and basic human kindness.\r\n\r\nMany First Nations people are now using the term \u201csoul wound\u201d or \u201cwounded spirit\u201d to describe the mental, physical and spiritual consequences the cumulative effect of colonialism, genocide and oppression has had on them as a People. We work to address the overrepresentation of Native Americans in Oregon prisons and jails. This disparity, coupled with the cycle of chemical addiction, violence, abuse, hatred, hopelessness and neglect in Native American communities fuels our commitment to supply transition information, guidance and support to Native American individuals, families and communities. \r\n\r\nRLTS is the ONLY organization in Oregon working to address Native American incarceration through direct treatment programs. The work of RLTS connects with the progressive work of our community, including but not limited to: homelessness, anti-racism work, Native sovereignty, mental health advocacy, anti-violence, child abuse, poverty and social justice issues. While the Department of Corrections budget continues to spiral out of control, the State ignores the glaring needs of incarcerated people: education, treatment, mental health counseling, job skills, and mentoring. Many of our clients have symptoms of internalized oppression; they carry the weight of generational racism and oppressive regimes that have blacked out traditional native teachings and ways of life. We draw upon our ancestors, our traditions, to rise above oppression. By rebuilding a broken strand of our social construction, RLTS\u2019s work with this underrepresented population addresses the underlying causes of Native American incarceration and contributes to the whole system of social change.\r\n",

Working closely with incarcerated Native Americans, we experienced firsthand the \u2018revolving door\u2019 known as recidivism. Inmates would confide in us, \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to go, I don\u2019t know what I will do.\u201d In February 2006 we formed a Board of Directors and began the process of crafting our mission and purpose: To prevent incarceration of Native Americans and provide assistance to incarcerated Native Americans who are proactively working toward creating a better life for themselves, their children, and their communities. Upon receiving non-profit status in 2007, we have continuously worked to promote and develop culturally competent pre and post incarceration programs which aid in prevention, responsibility, respect and empowerment of individuals, families and communities.  \r\n\r\nThe heart of our organization is our volunteer base, which has grown to over 70 community members. With their unwavering support, RLTS is gaining recognition within the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) administration and Native communities as a strong voice for incarcerated Native people. We are proud of our core prison programs, which have expanded and been refined over the last year in order to improve outcomes and serve more individuals. Yet, RLTS\u2019s major accomplishment is that the effects of RLTS can now \u2014and will continue to\u2014 be seen throughout the community. The visible effects of RLTS include:                                                                                                                        \r\n\u2022\tMore awareness about the realities of prison in the general community.\r\n\u2022\tSystematic change within ODOC, especially regarding Native Americans and re-entry planning.\r\n\u2022\tEmpowerment of more than 700 incarcerated and 58 released Native Americans and 10 others.\r\n\u2022\tHealing of intergenerational historical trauma from the legacy of genocide and substance abuse within Oregon tribes. \r\n\u2022\tNative community building, including specific support for children and families of incarcerated individuals. \r\n",

If I hadn\u2019t come to prison, I would never have seen a model of strong, responsible, respectful women.\u201d RLTS client.\r\n\r\nRLTS believes the high disparity levels of intergenerational incarceration among Native Americans is directly related to repeated historical traumas, violence, poverty, and substance abuse experienced and passed down through the generations. Historical trauma has been described as \u201cthe distress and suffering resulting from numerous compounding historically traumatic events experienced by a community over several generations\u201d (Yellow Horse Brave Heart, 1996). \r\n\r\nThe root causes of Native American incarceration, substance abuse addiction and parenting problems lie within the historical trauma that our culture has endured, including:\r\n\u2022\tA legacy of genocide so horrendous that it caused deep intergenerational trauma\u2014separating Indigenous people from their cultures, languages, traditions and families.\r\n\u2022\tA trauma of this magnitude often manifests as violence and addictions, and leads to involvement with the criminal justice system\u2014Incarceration is intergenerational.\r\n\u2022\tA culture of widely held stereotypes regarding Native people, as well as incarcerated people, that discourage compassion and basic human kindness.\r\n\r\nMany First Nations people are now using the term \u201csoul wound\u201d or \u201cwounded spirit\u201d to describe the mental, physical and spiritual consequences the cumulative effect of colonialism, genocide and oppression has had on them as a People. We work to address the overrepresentation of Native Americans in Oregon prisons and jails. This disparity, coupled with the cycle of chemical addiction, violence, abuse, hatred, hopelessness and neglect in Native American communities fuels our commitment to supply transition information, guidance and support to Native American individuals, families and communities. \r\n\r\nRLTS is the ONLY organization in Oregon working to address Native American incarceration through direct treatment programs. The work of RLTS connects with the progressive work of our community, including but not limited to: homelessness, anti-racism work, Native sovereignty, mental health advocacy, anti-violence, child abuse, poverty and social justice issues. While the Department of Corrections budget continues to spiral out of control, the State ignores the glaring needs of incarcerated people: education, treatment, mental health counseling, job skills, and mentoring. Many of our clients have symptoms of internalized oppression; they carry the weight of generational racism and oppressive regimes that have blacked out traditional native teachings and ways of life. We draw upon our ancestors, our traditions, to rise above oppression. By rebuilding a broken strand of our social construction, RLTS\u2019s work with this underrepresented population addresses the underlying causes of Native American incarceration and contributes to the whole system of social change.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "PCUN was founded in 1985, seeking to add labor and farmworker rights to the then-eight year long campaigns focused on immigrants' rights and legal defense against deportation.  PCUN's achievements include signing the first agricultural collective bargaining agreement in Oregon, overcoming agribusiness\u2019 entrenched opposition to an agricultural collective bargaining law, winning paid breaks for farmworkers, helping increase/defend the state minimum wage, and invalidating restrictions on picketing rights.  Our most recent breakthrough was co-leading the push to enact SB 833, signed by Gov. Kitzhaber on May 1st, creating \"Driver's Cards\" for Oregon drivers who cannot demonstrate legal presence.\r\n\r\nPCUN has co-founded and/or united the organizations that make up the \u201cCAPACES\u201d network\u2014ten groups that serve and organize the Latino immigrant community in the Mid-Willamette Valley.  Most recently, PCUN co-led the successful campaigns to establish the CAPACES Leadership Institute, the newest CAPACES organization.\r\n\r\nOregon has the nation\u2019s second highest minimum wage ($8.95/hour), thanks largely to union-led ballot initiatives.  From 1997 to 2005, PCUN and allies defeated agribusiness\u2019 legislative attempts to exclude farmworkers from increases. Despite these gains, the minimum is routinely violated in key sectors of Oregon agriculture.  In February, 2010, PCUN released a survey documenting that, in piece-rate harvests, the vast majority of farmworkers are routinely not paid the minimum.  Wages in berry harvests averaged $5.30/hour and the aggregate underpayments in the 2009 in those harvests statewide were estimated to exceed $9,000,000.\r\n\r\nTo address this kind of rampant injustice, PCUN co-founded and plays a central role in The Oregon Coalition to Stop Wage Theft, initiated in 2010 by the Northwest Worker Justice Project (NWJP).  The Coalition has brought together labor, faith groups, social justice and progressive legal groups to support workers who take action, push for stronger protections and create a climate where wage theft is socially repugnant.",

    "narrative3": "Wage theft has reached epidemic proportions due a bad economy, desperate and vulnerable workers, hostility toward immigrants, the proliferation of \u201ccontingent\u201d work arrangements, and repeated budget cut-backs which have decimated the government agency staff devoted to enforcement.   Immigrant workers, especially the undocumented, are the most vulnerable, because they find themselves at the intersection of class exploitation, racism, and xenophobia. For immigrant women, sexual harassment and exploitation are also often in the mix, adding \u201csexism\u201d as a fourth layer of oppression.  \r\n\r\nPCUN is taking a proactive and leading role in combating wage theft affecting farmworkers and immigrant workers in Oregon.  PCUN and the Coalition are focused on four core strategies.  First, we are raising public awareness and intensifying the stigma associated with wage theft.  Second, we are educating workers at risk of wage theft about their rights, about practical strategies to prevent and counter wage theft.  Third, we are marshaling legal and moral support for workers who have been victimized by wage theft and who decide to take concerted action.  Fourth, we are pressing the Oregon Legislature to pass legislation which increases regulation and penalties on labor brokers, \u201ctemp\u201d agencies, closes legal loopholes such as abuse of \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status, and hold those who benefit from labor accountable for the unscrupulous acts of their contractors and sub-contractors.  \r\n\r\nWith support from Social Justice Fund and others, PCUN stepped up its anti-wage theft organizing in 2012 and the beginning of 2013.  PCUN and Coalition partners have: \r\n\u2022\tRecruited more private attorneys to handle the burgeoning number of legal claims surfaced by the campaign:\r\n\u2022\tSuccessfully enlisted the Oregon Bureau of Labor & Industries to activate payout from a modest fund established to partially pay claims against contractors who have no recoverable assets;\r\n\u2022\tOrganized a half dozen high visibility worker forums across Oregon; \r\n\u2022\tEngaged thousands of workers weekly on wage theft issues and PCUN/Coalition activities via radio programming;\r\n\u2022\tDeveloped, tested and refined popular education curricula, in collaboration for the CAPACES Leadership Institute, offering simple but effective strategies to avoid, detect and pursue wage theft;\r\n\u2022\tSharpened the critical thinking of 50 new and emerging leaders, mostly in CAPACES organizations via the CAPACES 101 session called Ag Wealth in the Mid-Willamette Valley:  Who has created it and who controls it?\u201d casting the wealth \u201cgap\u201d between growers and workers as a \u201ccrime scene\u201d and analyzing the \u201csuspects\u201d (human and institutional);\r\n\u2022\tMobilized 100 workers and supporters to legislative hearings on the Coalition\u2019s legislation.\r\n\r\nOn the legislative front, the Coalition\u2019s package of five bills, first rolled out in the 2011 Oregon Legislature, are getting more traction in the 2013 session; one bill will likely be enacted, (requiring registration and bond-posting by labor brokers in construction, a hotbed of wage theft).  \r\n",

    "narrative4": "The heavy lifting and painstaking start-up work done by PCUN and the Coalition have brought workers forward, and has put wage theft on the minds of the public, the agenda of policy-makers and regulators, and the radar of lawyers and legal services groups.  Workers like Rafael have confronted their formers employers, spoken out via mass media, testified in Salem, and urged others to step forward.  In short, addressing wage theft has attained real traction, but not yet enough to overcome entrenched fear among most workers, indifference or risk-taking (about potential consequences) among most business or property owners, and hostility within business and temp agency associations.  Our work now must build out the ranks of workers ready to go public and take action, and deepen the commitment of key allies willing to use their skills and/or influence to address wage theft and make institutional change.\r\n\r\nA wild card (and also a huge catalyst) one this path is Congressional action on comprehensive immigration reform and a legalization program which could bring forward and benefit ten million immigrants, including 100,000 to 140,000 in Oregon.  The organization response required for such a \"tsunami\" will affect every immigrant-based organization and issue, but it will also create unprecedented opportunities for engagement (e.g., via mass education sessions and, later, individual consultations).\r\n\r\nKey benchmarks we identify for evaluation include expanding the worker committee size and the consistency of participation, recruiting and activating a dozen lawyers and law students, persuading legislative leaders to convene an interim committee to sustain momentum for legislation, and securing a deeper commitment from building trades locals and reputable contractor associations in support of institutional reform.  An ongoing challenge will be maintaining these capacities and results in a reasonable state of alignment (e.g., sufficient legal support for workers who decide to pursue claims).\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "In addition to the coalition combatting wage theft, PCUN had a leadership role in the \u201cManagement Team\u201d of \u201cReform Immigration For America,\u201d leading the struggle for comprehensive immigration reform.  In 2013, the Team was expanded become the \"Coordinating Committee\" and the campaign re-branded as \"Alliance for Citizenship\", but PCUN remains one of only a handful of local or statewide organizations represented.  PCUN was one of only ten organizations who co-founded the predecessor \u201cCoalition for Comprehensive Immigration Reform\u201d in 2003.  The Alliance for Citizenship includes National Council of La Raza, SEIU, United Food and Commercial Workers, AFL-CIO, NAACP, Asian-American Justice Center, Center for Community Change (CCC), the Fair Immigration Reform Movement, National Immigration Forum, and immigrants\u2019 rights coalitions in New York, Los Angeles, and Maryland. PCUN's has long had a unique role as an organization with deep roots and relationships in multiple realms, e.g., organized labor, immigrants' rights organizations, LGBT allies, legal services groups, civil rights, civil liberties, and funders, among others.  These ties have proven critical in period of heightened tensions arising from cultural and political differences and/or the divergence of interests.  PCUN leaders have been go-to \"bridge-builders\" or fence-menders on multiple occasions.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, PCUN, the United Farm Workers, Farmworker Justice, Farm Labor Organizing Committee, OxFam America and others co-initiated what today is known as the \u201cEquitable Food Initiative,\u201d working to fashion and market a \u201csustainability\u201d label for agricultural products which includes meaningful and effective standards for working conditions.  PCUN has played a key role in developing the worker training and leadership development components of the model, a feature sorely lacking in most other \"sustainability\" models.   \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "PCUN is people-of-color led and always has been.  White allies have always been welcome to particpate, even in leadership roles, provided they make and fulfill a commitment to the leadership of people of color and the interests of workers.  \r\n\r\nOur movement has made great strides in creating the space and capacity for working class people of color\u2014mostly immigrants\u2014to have a meaningful voice in their workplaces and in civic affairs.  Even as we strive to expand those opportunities and make them more impactful, we are mindful that we must keep a consistent focus on the ideas conveyed.\r\n\r\nWorking to combat and transform what we call the \u201cisms\u201d (racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, etc.) has long figured at the center of our work and the CAPACES Leadership Institute will build substantially on this tradition.  For example, a prime focus of the \u201cCAPACES 101\u201d course, in which PCUN enrolls all new staff and aspiring movement leadership, is our articulation of the \u201cIsms\u201d, how they manifest in ourselves and our work, and how we discern the difference between personal \u201cprejudice\u201d and institutional discrimination. \r\n\r\nOne defining struggle for PCUN is our two-decade\u2019s old alliance with LGBTQ organizations.  PCUN first took an outspoken stance against anti-gay attacks in 1992, putting us at odds with the sentiments of most Latino community leaders and, frankly, the bulk of our membership and community base.  Our efforts to be (and be known as) a safe space for LGBTQ folks and to re-frame the debate as one about equality (rather than \u201cmorality\u201d) has been impactful, though there\u2019s clearly much work remaining, both within PCUN and the community.  One recent new opportunity involves a new weekly radio show called La Voz de Todos, produced by \u201cout\u201d Latinos/as and which explicitly addresses LGBTQ issues.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "In this time of increasing obscene and damaging inequities in income distribution, unemployment and under-employment, stagnating wages, and economic insecurity for workers, wage theft stands out as perhaps the rawest form of economic injustice.  For a worker promised a sub-livability wage, pushed--often harassed--for maximum productivity, and kept in limbo about future employment prospects, the failure to pay the wages owed adds a stinging insult to the abject injury of theft.  The ability to attain redress--collect wages--is a plain express of economic justice and the vindication offers some healing to the theft's indignities.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to gain legal immigration status and driving privileges may not be immediately associated with anti-wage theft work or with economic justice.  We contend, however, that they are critical and directly relevant components in our economic justice work.  Workers who obtain permission to work and, eventually, permanent residence and citizenship, are much more likely to seek redress, become more invested in shaping the legal and political system in this country, and are perceived by employers and contractors as less vulnerable.  The path to permanent legal status will likely entail some type of \"classes\" which, though aimed primarily at basic language and civics, offer community organizations a golden opportunity to convey information and messages about rights and remedies.  \r\n\r\nOregon's just-enacted \"Driver's Card\" program is also an anti-wage theft initiative.  Workers who lack mobility are often further controlled and exploited by contractors.  The degree of independence and basic security afforded by being able to drive legally empowers workers to avoid wage theft and to take action to pursue a claim if they are victimized.  Issuance of the four-year, renewable Card begins January 1st.  Oregon is only the second state to restore driving access.\r\n\r\nIn short, legalization and \"Driver's Cards\" ARE economic justice strategies.",

    "narrative1": "Montana Women Vote was founded in 2000 to engage, organize, and mobilize low-income women as informed voters, policy advocates, and community leaders.  MWV believes that economic justice issues do not exist in a vacuum - rather, they overlap with and encompass issues of racial justice, LGBT rights, access to health care and basic services, education, reproductive justice, human rights, and environmental justice.  MWV is a statewide coalition with 11 member organizations that work on many of these issues and inform how MWV works at the intersections of oppression and identity.  We work to improve the lives of low-income women through organizing and policy change; we also develop the leadership and influence of low-income women in the decision-making processes that affect their lives.\r\n\r\nMWV does this in three main ways: first, we highlight connections between what's on the ballot, and who's in charge, and women's lived experiences; second, we create leadership opportunities and break down barriers to participation in order to shift the balance of power; and third, we mobilize low-income women to win lasting policy changes.\r\n\r\nRecent accomplishments include:\r\n - Campaign for Medicaid expansion in state legislature that, while unsuccessful, engaged thousands across the state, framed the public debate, and set us up for future efforts\r\n - Lasting policy wins including increasing the state minimum wage, expanding the state children's health insurance program, capping payday lending interest rates, and protecting state investment in vital services through the state budget\r\n - More than 17,000 low-income and \"unlikely\" women voters registered\r\n - 89,000 voter guides produced and distributed via mail, tabling, and door-to-door\r\n - Average of 5 contacts made to each unlikely woman voter throughout each election cycle\r\n - Average voter turnout increase from 35% to 60% for low-income women involved with MWV\r\n - Hundreds of volunteers engaged across the state",

    "narrative3": "Montana Women Vote was founded in response to a profound lack of support for and attention to issues facing low-income women demonstrated by elected officials.  We realized that voter turnout rates for low-income women were about 30%, less than half the state average.  This meant that low-income women had little say in electing their representatives, were seen as politically irrelevant, and were shown little accountability by their representatives.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the disenfranchisement of low-income women is both caused by and a perpetuation of deep and structural poverty.  Low-income women don't fail to vote due to apathy; rather, they face structural barriers such as lack of transportation, childcare, or help reading or translating ballots; they lack the information they need to vote; and they don't feel welcome participating in processes that work against them.  In turn, the absence of voices of low-income women allows elected officials to further inequality, create policies that distribute wealth upward, ignore the basic needs of women and families, children, and people of color, and consolidate power in the hands of the privileged.\r\n\r\nMWV works to address this in two ways: by changing policies to address the day-to-day experience of living in poverty, and by organizing low-income women as leaders and policy advocates within existing power structures.  We believe that neither policy change nor leadership development alone will solve the issues of deep, structural poverty - but that these approaches can fundamentally shift the balance of power, leaving low-income women more and more in charge of their own lives and able to identify and implement solutions that work for them and their communities.\r\n\r\nIn this way, too, MWV works to build collective power - by addressing policies and structures that keep people empowered or powerless, and by creating opportunities for individuals, communities, and our constituency across the state to build and exert political power.  For example, in 2012 we worked to register women living in pre-release centers and court-ordered drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities.  By law, people living in these centers are eligible to vote; however, many facility staff were at best misinformed and at worst actively disenfranchising their clients.  We confronted this on two fronts:  first, working center by center to build relationships with staff and clients, provide information, and show up with voter registration forms and information.  Second, we worked with the Secretary of State's office to provide a memo and analysis of the law to facilities in order to prevent future disenfranchisement.  This work helped to shift the balance of power both on a local level - who had power within each pre-release center, for example, and more broadly, by illuminating the rights of women leaving incarceration to vote if they so choose.",

    "narrative4": "Our work in the coming year focuses on organizing around two main issue areas:  access to health care, particularly expanding access to Montana's Medicaid program, and protecting voter rights.  We believe both issues will appear on the 2014 ballot:  Medicaid expansion as a pro-active citizen's initiative, and attacks on voter rights as a legislative referendum.  Therefore, our strategies will include voter registration and mobilization, political education and persuasion, and media work including traditional and social media and storytelling.  Each strategy will be best achieved by deepening existing collaborations and building new relationships with progressive leaders and organizations.  \r\n\r\nMWV has engaged deeply with both issues in the past, including as recently as the 2013 legislative session.  We will build on the campaigns we ran over the last few years, re-engaging constituents, volunteers, and community leaders, and deepening the analysis and education we can provide.  We will continue to prioritize the voices of those most affected, and lift up the connections and intersections between these issues and others (such as access to reproductive health care and disenfranchisement of Native voters).\r\n\r\nMWV works to evaluate and assess all our work to the extent possible.  Our most important test is whether we can measure a concrete difference in the lives of our constituents - winning access to health care for uninsured folks, for example, or lasting policy change.  We also set numerical benchmarks for our organizing efforts, ask our local steering committees and volunteers to provide feedback and critique, and evaluate our campaign work with our coalition partners.\r\n\r\nBecause MWV strives to do our work in a way that not only furthers our goals but is also movement-building, we also assess our successes in being a good ally, building the leadership of those most affected, and framing the public debate with our shared values.

    "narrative5": "Montana Voices: Montana Voices is our state's 501(c)3 coalition, representing a broad range of organizations working on civic engagement, voter registration, and ballot initiative campaigns.  MT Voices works to foster collaboration, transparency, and synergy in our state's progressive movement.  MT Voices provides access to data, research, and national civic engagement models to help us sharpen our work on the ground.  Since January of 2013, Sarah Howell has served as the chair of the MT Voices' board.\r\n\r\nPartnership for Montana's Future: MWV is a founding member of this coalition representing education advocates, seniors, women, people with disabilities, children, environmental organizations, and Native American organizations.  The Partnership began in 2011 as a way to fight state budget cuts to services and education, and promote sensible revenue solutions.  Since then, it has grown to include a role as a convener of ballot initiative and legislative campaigns, including efforts to defeat ballot referenda aimed at cutting taxes on the 2012 ballot and efforts to repeal an oil and gas tax holiday in the 2013 legislative session.  The Partnership also serves as an information-sharing and relationship-building hub. \r\n\r\nMWV believes deeply in the benefit of collaborative work and in the need for a movement-building approach to progressive organizing.  Building broad and deep coalitions, whether lasting or ad hoc, helps us identify shared values and common goals.  These collaborative efforts are especially important in a state like Montana, where those most affected by many of the issues we work on are a small minority and deeply marginalized.  We must work together in order to shift the balance of power.", 
    "narrative6": "MWV began as a white organization without a racial justice frame and has been working for the last seven years on internal anti-racist organizational development, relationship-building with communities of color across the state, and policy and organizing work as an ally.  We believe that economic justice cannot be achieved while ignoring racial justice, human rights, LGBT equality, and reproductive justice, and we see our work and our analysis as intersectional.  We work to highlight both shared impacts and shared values between economic justice work and racial justice, LGBT equality, and reproductive justice.  \r\n\r\nFor example, in 2012 MWV opposed LR-121, an anti-immigrant referendum.  We worked to educate our mostly white constituency about immigrant rights, using our values framework around dignity and opportunity.  We are now engaging around comprehensive immigration reform and are able to refer back to that earlier work as we activate our members.  We are using a national framework that includes a gender lens and is LGBT-inclusive - Keep All Families Together.  We are able to identify for our constituency the similar attacks on dignity, opportunity, and family that immigrants face; we are also able to demonstrate how working as an ally to support immigrant rights builds progressive power and benefits all people.\r\n\r\nIn Montana, a crucial aspect of racial justice work for MWV is working as an ally to American Indian communities.  We continue to prioritize educating our base, and engaging as an active and assertive ally, around sovereignty and issues facing American Indians.  In 2012, we partnered with Western Native Voice to coordinate voter registration efforts.  In the 2013 legislative session, we worked with Western Native Voice on Medicaid expansion, highlighting the impacts on Medicaid expansion on Indian country and lifting up the voices and storied of Native women in media work, legislative hearings, and member outreach.\r\n\r\nWe are proud of the progress of Montana Women Vote, our staff and leaders, and our constituency with regard to moving a racial justice analysis as an ally.  We believe that we must be able to begin with education and move to action in our work as an ally.  We look forward to deepening our work with Western Native Voice, Indian People's Action, and other organizations, coalitions, and leaders of color. ",

The two issue campaigns described in this proposal - Medicaid expansion and protecting voter rights - both have major implications for economic justice.\r\n\r\nExpanding eligibility for Montana's Medicaid program would provide access to quality health care for 70,000 Montanans.  Many of these are people working in low-wage jobs, living with injuries or disabilities, or struggling with unmet mental health needs.  Of the 70,000 Montanans, at least 20,000 of the newly covered would be American Indian.  \r\n\r\nWe know that access to quality health care without facing enormous medical debt is crucial for economic well-being.  Medicaid expansion is an extraordinary opportunity - a chance to expand access to social safety-net services.  We feel it is not an exaggeration to say this is a once-in-a-generation campaign for low-income Montanans.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, attacks on voter rights disproportionately disenfranchise low-income voters, including women and American Indian voters.  There are many reasons one might need to utilize Election Day registration - without this process thousands of Montanans will lose their vote and be deemed politically powerless once again.  This attack on voter rights most directly impacts people living in rural communities, low-income women, American Indians, people with disabilities, people who do shift work, among others.\r\n\r\nFinally, the work outlined in this proposal aims to build power within low-income communities, contribute to progressive movement-building, and increase the capacity of our constituency to create social change.

This also marked the 6th anniversary of Palouse Pride being merged with Inland Oasis, Inc. \r\nHIV services were incorporated into Inland Oasis, Inc. in 2008 by being one of three Idaho Community Based Organizations to provide HIV antibody testing. HIV services expanded in 2011 by providing Ryan White Part B Medical Case Management for 5 Idaho counties. Expansion occurred again in 2011 with the addition of Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) services. As of early April 2013, the Executive Director of Inland Oasis, Inc. was also elected for a second term as the community co-chair for the Idaho Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS allowing continued statewide collaboration in addressing the needs of those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. This programming is also experiencing preliminary success with expanded services and collaboration with the Nez Perce tribe, a goal established in 2008. This expansion is exceptionally exciting when considering the predominately Caucasian population of the area. \r\nAdditional landmarks of 2011 include obtaining a permanent, full-time location for Inland Oasis, Inc. allowing access 35+ hours per week, as well as the instigation of weekly meetings of the Palouse Gender Variant Group (now with approximately 20 regularly participating members).

    "narrative3": "In terms of sexual orientation and gender identity, one of the biggest issues most currently addressed by Inland Oasis, Inc. is a sense of community and belonging. Unfortunately, this seems to be caused by two main situations.  One, many individuals are misinformed about LGBTQI issues, and secondly, some people are committed to discriminatory beliefs toward the orientation and gender spectrum.  Luckily, our biggest successes in addressing a sense of inclusion comes from the annual Palouse Pride events as well as an annual Family Thanksgiving event, hosted in collaboration with the University of Idaho and Washington State University. Additionally, Inland Oasis, Inc. was involved in hosting phone banks in preparation of Referendum 74 as well as advocacy leading up to the sexual orientation and gender identity protection ordinance, recently successfully passed by the Moscow City Council. \r\nThe 2014-2016 Strategic Plan (currently being written) includes implementation of another large scale community-based event to occur every spring. Furthermore, the recent opening of a LGBTQIA bar in the Lewiston area (approximately 30 miles south of Moscow and within our service jurisdiction), will allow increased collaboration and enhanced community reach. Through the continuation and expansion of community events,  it is expected to see increased \"community buy-in\" to promoting inclusion and greater LGBTQia community in the Palouse region. \r\nRelating to HIV/AIDS services, there are multiple issues being addressed. For positive diagnosed individuals, case management is executed following a self-reliance model. This facilitates immediate resolution to various circumstances experienced by this population while also equipping clients to address similar future incidences. In addressing the population seeking testing services, two of the biggest issues are engaging in high-risk behavior and lack of condom use. Broader safer sex education is essential to combating these issues. Specifically, education is occurring  targeting the various classifications of risk and promoting  client level understanding of risk factors. Broad education regarding condom use, with particular focus on use with young men who have sex with men (who, having gotten minimal sex education at the high school level, believe condoms are only for pregnancy prevention), as well as promoting self-reliance for condom provision and use among receptive partners, is currently being designed for a launch/implementation date of August 2013. \r\nIncreased education will allow documentation of fewer repeat high-risk testers, increased self protection/preservation and enhanced community health outcomes. It is also expected this education will recruit new testers, discovering undiagnosed HIV infections and immediate connection to care. \r\nIn a broader capacity, through training of the Board and energetic outreach to LGBTQIA individuals, providing opportunities for training and involvement in collaborative events and efforts, Inland Oasis, Inc. is building a collective base of support for social reform and a powerful sense of community.

    "narrative4": "In early 2013 the Inland Oasis, Inc. Board of Directors, along with its Program Directors began a long-term strategic planning process. This process identified no less than eighty (80) distinct goals and strategies (approximately twenty-five (25) of which are to be completed within the first year) pertaining to programmatic long-term planning as well as agency long-term growth and planning, to be accomplished within a 10-year period.  A finalized comprehensive strategic plan is to be released by the end of 2013. This process is also considered one of the highest priority goals/strategies for the next twelve months. \r\nAn additional large and high priority goal for 2013 include creating a comprehensive Policies and Procedures manual, including both agency and programmatic policies, with consideration towards exit strategies for long-term stability and increased community visibility and involvement. \r\nSuccess of these example goals will be determined by review and evaluation of final products, not only through an internal process but also through a community process. Additionally, success will be evaluated by adherence to prescribed deadlines and various applicable milestones. \r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "One of Inland Oasis, Inc.'s strongest collaborations is with two of the community\u2019s most prominent and enduring leaders. Not only do these women own and operate Moscow\u2019s two oldest LGBTQIA businesses, they also execute a monthly drag show that celebrated its 18th Anniversary in February 2013. These women have been heavily involved in Inland Oasis, Inc; they have been Board members and one is the 2013 Palouse Pride Director. They supported the implementation and current success of Inland Oasis, Inc.\u2019s HIV services. Through their drag show, Inland Oasis, Inc. has access to hundreds of LGBTQIA individuals every month, where we promote condom usage, HIV testing and sexual risk reduction. This population would not be as accessible without this social outlet. \r\nThe University of Idaho\u2019s presence allows Inland Oasis, Inc. to collaborate with various campus offices. A current campus collaboration is with the UI Violence Prevention Programs through the Dean of Students Office in addressing domestic  and dating violence, sexual assault and stalking  among the LGBTQIA community both on and off campus. Inland Oasis, Inc. will be participating in various trainings to be better equipped as a point of contact when encountering  LGBTQIA  survivors. This is especially important as this situation has occurred not only in the delivery of HIV testing services, but also in the weekly gender variant support group meeting. \r\nAnother collaboration is with the University of Idaho\u2019s Women\u2019s Center/LGBTQA Office. In addition to supporting their work towards gender and sexual orientation equality, Inland Oasis, Inc. is part of the planning body for \u201cGot Sex?\u201d, a monthly sexual health educational program. This program gives students, representing the gender and orientation spectrum, a safe space to discuss various sexual topics, ask questions, and receive accurate information and resources regarding healthy and safe sexual activities. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Efforts towards racial justice can be difficult in a predominately white area. Being located on the Idaho/Washington border does provide some racial diversity, in large part due to the University of Idaho and Washington State University. However, racial diversity is not as easily observed among the year-round resident population. Inland Oasis, Inc. is currently building a strong collaboration with the Nez Perce Tribal Health (Nimiipuu Health) located within 60 miles of Moscow. Presently, this collaboration is targeting the integration of HIV testing and sexual risk reduction into the health center in various capacities.  Additionally, sexual health and risk reduction education will be presented by the Inland Oasis, Inc. Executive Director during an upcoming Nimiipuu \u201cYouth Night\u201d. Some of the biggest barriers that have been identified are very rooted within this community\u2019s culture. From what Inland Oasis, Inc. has observed, the dynamics of this Tribe\u2019s culture can be extremely limiting towards sexual orientation, sexual health, mental health and even seeking care (many individuals will not seek care due to an overly \u201ctight-knit\u201d community and the resulting \u201cNow everybody knows my business\u201d phenomenon). Through the educational component, young individuals will be equipped to make safe, healthy decisions. Additionally, this education will contain sexual orientation and gender identity inclusivity in order to challenge those oppressions while also contributing to long-term community health. Through the process of normalizing services, the oppression commonly associated with stigma will be challenged. This also facilitates reaching the broader community allowing the conversation to continue in a different capacity and ultimately challenging, and possibly changing, \u201ccultural norms.\"\r\nAnother direction Inland Oasis, Inc. is going  is the integration of Spanish-speaking individuals, with particular focus on HIV testing and case management staff.  This language barrier is detrimental not only to the staff\u2019s ability to communicate with a native Spanish speaker, but also in determining whether or not that individual will even seek services. Communicating with an individual in his/her native language ultimately allows this population to be empowered to seek services. \r\nFinally, economic disparities are frequently encountered. The area is extremely rural with a large population at, or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. Economics routinely influence whether or not individuals seek services. By providing services at no cost to the individual, Inland Oasis, Inc. is able to strengthen this area's community, regardless of income. ",

    "narrative3": "ICAN prioritizes issues that address racial, social, and economic inequalities with an understanding that the root cause of these inequalities is low income and communities of color not having the political clout necessary to advance their interests.  ICAN supports a platform with five issues that dig deep down into the root causes of poverty:\r\n1.\tFAIR LENDING-fair access to credit that is non-discriminatory and non-predatory, fair banking practices and stopping foreclosures\r\n2.\tFAIR PUBLIC FINANCE-restore funding for education and vital health services.\r\n3.\tFAIR TAXES-end tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and make them pay their fair share\r\n4.\tFAIR EMPLOYMENT-living wages and job security\r\n5.     FAIR IMMIGRATION REFORM- reform that supports family unity and a path to citizenship\r\n  \r\nICAN builds collective power through community organizing.  We believe in reaching out to meet people where they are at.  The strategies we are using to build collective power include:\r\n\u2022\tIndividual recruitment- door knocking, phone canvass,  home visits, house meetings\r\n\u2022\tInstitutional recruitment-meetings and  presentations with churches, education and labor groups\r\n\u2022\tCommunity recruitment- direct outreach to immigrants and small businesses through the radio broadcasting\r\n\u2022\tCoalition building-continuously building power-sometimes with unlikely allies \r\n\r\nICAN educates leaders about how the economic system and racism work together to create the inequity prevalent in our country.  ICAN empowers leaders to address these underlying systems through collective action.  ICAN believes that once leaders are trained, they become the best organizers for building local program bases.  ICAN members have many opportunities to receive training and education on issues and community organizing through:\r\n\u2022\tLocal issue education training\r\n\u2022\tLocal one-day community organizing training\r\n\u2022\tLocal skill development training-speech and writing \r\n\u2022\tRegional four-day organizer training\r\n\u2022\tRegional leadership development- training leaders to be trainers\r\nICAN leaders actively invest in and build strong state and national coalitions.  While we organize key constituencies in an often overlooked geography we will not make the changes we care about alone.    \r\n\u2022\tState Coalition building:  ICAN has worked to build state coalitions for Immigration Reform, on Medicaid and Pay Day lending.  These coalitions include: labor, churches, Latino and farm worker organizations, small businesses, service organizations and disability groups \r\n\u2022\tNational Coalitions and Alliances include: Alliance For A Just Society, New Bottom Line, Fair Immigration Reform Movement, National People\u2019s Action and National Council of La Raza. \r\nICAN brings analysis, policy, people from impacted communities, and an action orientation to these coalitions.\r\nProgressive systemic change is often challenging given the conservative climate in the state.  ICAN works to educate disenfranchised Idahoans using an ideology that represents a value of fairness; a value that is often absent from the conservative dialogue.  It is through this value of fairness that ICAN builds a power base that will collectively change the power dynamics and alter the political climate of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative4": "ICAN is continuously building the power necessary to create systemic changes that have a positive impact in our communities.  Our goals and objectives focus on winning concrete victories with fair lending, fair public financing and fair immigration reform.\r\nOver the next year, ICAN will take a multi-prong approach to address the predatory lending issue and takes both local and state based plans.  \r\nFirst, working with Mayor Nancolas, ICAN will organize a local campaign in the city of Caldwell for a city ordinance that will drive predatory lenders out of the city.  Second, ICAN will reach out to surrounding communities in the Treasure Valley and press for a collective action by the Treasure Valley Partnership to institute similar city ordinances that will drive predatory lenders out of the Treasure Valley. The third prong is moving a larger state wide campaign that gets to the heart of the predatory lending issue with a state rate cap of 36% on all loan products.  \r\nICAN will continue work with the Medicaid Matters coalition to secure funding of healthcare for all Idahoan\u2019s up to 138% of the poverty level.  Expanding Medicaid will help move our goal of fair financing of public programs in Idaho.  With years of cuts to education, mental, dental and physical health, our plan to ensure funding for our most vulnerable populations will include outreach and base building with people directly impacted.\r\nFinally, ICAN will continue to support a larger campaign for fair immigration reform. With a strong desire to bring families out of the shadows and allow them compete fairly and safely in our economy we will continue support a national solution.  ICAN will continue to engage all communities in the value the immigrant communities bring to our economy.\r\nWe will assess meeting our objectives based on concrete victories.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "At ICAN we strongly value the building of coalitions at both state and national levels as a tool for creating a larger movement.  Adding to the previous list of national affiliations, ICAN also prioritizes state collaborations as a strategy for building a more progressive climate and to win on local issues in Idaho.\r\nICAN created a fair lending coalition last year to build power for a state rate cap on payday and title loans. Working with Debt Reduction Services of Idaho, Catholic Charities of Idaho, Voices of the Poor (Committee of Society of St. Vincent de Paul), AARP and Community Action Partnership, we believe we are in a stronger position to win this rate cap in 2014.\r\nICAN also created a state based coalition for fair immigration reform. With this collaboration that includes many diverse groups like the Community Council of Idaho, we have been able to move Congressional delegate to support a path to citizenship.\r\nAt times we have found \"unlikely\" allies who support our issues.  With immigration reform, ICAN found support from the Idaho Dairyman Association.  With the fair lending campaign, ICAN found support from Debt Reduction Services.  We believe collaborating with diverse groups impacted by the issue helps make our voice more powerful and helps create both short term victories and long term movement building as it shows intersections of shared principles and values.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "ICAN strongly believes in racial justice and we recognize the connection between racism and social and economic justice.  With a historical past of being a primarily white-led organization, ICAN built a program called Community Dialogues as a tool to talk about immigration in predominately white communities. \r\nIn addition to learning about the current broken system for immigration, participants in this program gain a new understanding of the positive impact immigrants have in our communities. This tool has been successful in helping to bridge the divide between Latino and white communities and has moved our membership to look at all of our issues through a racial justice lens.\r\nWith this different perspective, we can take a second look at an issue, fair lending for example, and see that predatory lending disproportionately impacts people of color.  In this case, predatory lenders establish businesses more often in communities of color. It then becomes clear that to win on this issue, we must build a diverse base that includes representation from all communities impacted.\r\nICAN stands with the Gay and Lesbian communities against homophobia.  This has been a key principle in immigration reform as advanced through our alliance with FIRM.   \r\nICAN advances a racial justice perspective on every issue ICAN prioritizes.  Bringing diverse communities together to speak their truth about how the issues are impacting them, and then letting them see the same issue from the perspective of  someone from another community is powerful. The desire to do something about the issue turns into a passion for justice through this lens and tends to have a powerful transformative effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

IPA was formed to fight for equity and to preserve the rights of Native Americans in urban towns and the border towns at the edge of the seven Indian reservations.  IPA works to achieve its mission by training and developing low-income Native American leaders, working to build strong coalitions and partnering with tribes and other native organizations. In addition, IPA uses participatory research and communications to get its message out.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n*IPA has strong relationships on the reservations Crow, Fort Belknap and Northern Cheyenne. IPA partners to extend its reach and address issues of discrimination.\r\n\r\n*Participatory Research includes \"Addressing Racial Profiling: To Protect and Serve? Unequal Treatment in the Billings Police Department\" October 24, 2005. A study conducted by the IPA reveals problems within the police department that lead to distrust and fear among residents. Last year, IPA collected 11 stories and published a storybook, \"Is Help on the Way?\" Native American Stories about the Ambulance Service in Hardin.\r\n*Building and participating in coalitions. IPA played a key role in Montana's fight for health care (Health Care for American Now -- Montana). IPA brought the perspective of native people to the tale and fought and was part of winning the Affordable Care Act, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and addressing health inequities.\r\n*IPA runs local issues campaigns -- for example through listening sessions IPA uncovered ambulance abuse cases in Hardin, MT. Through the listening sessions, leaders were identified and developed. IPA was successful in forming a local team to bring light to how native people were neglected by the Hardin Ambulance service. \r\n\r\n",

We have three program areas: government accountability, tax and fiscal policy, and Wyoming working people. ESPC provides information and trainings for citizen advocates to boost civic engagement. In 2008, we hired a field organizer to build leadership in native and immigrant communities, intending that those Leadership Councils will mature into independent organizations and coalition members.\r\n\r\nMajor accomplishments include:\r\n* During the 2013 Legislature, we mobilized member agencies and supporters to kill a bill mandating \u201ctip pooling\u201d in service jobs. We also pressured the Governor to veto a change to unemployment law that would have meant workers fired for unintentional, honest mistakes would be unable to get those benefits; the Governor vetoed this bill and his comments on it incorporated ESPC\u2019s language.\r\n* We did voter turnout and education work in advance of the 2012 primary and general elections. Our work on the Wind River Reservation was especially successful, increasing turnout in two precincts by more than 16% (compared to 2008) and garnering significant publicity. \r\n* We have built a statewide network of supporters who we are able to mobilize when needed. This was a major factor in killing the tip pooling bill and getting the Governor to veto the unemployment bill.

    "narrative3": "Our work addresses three main areas: tax policy, worker safety/rights, and civic engagement. In Wyoming, the state receives significant income from mineral severance taxes; however, the tax structure is not always set up to provide maximum benefit to the general public. For example, a new rare earth mine is proposed for northeast Wyoming. Currently, the severance tax rate for rare earth minerals is 2%; we would like to see that raised significantly, reflecting the current value of and demand for these minerals. As for worker safety/rights, Wyoming has one of the worst records in the U.S. for workplace fatalities, and a high rate of serious workplace accidents. Unscrupulous employers deny discharged workers their final pay. Institutional protections fail when county attorneys do not prosecute these bosses after workers win wage adjudication cases. Wyoming\u2019s minimum wage has been $5.15/hour since 1999; one-third of Wyoming workers are not covered by the Federal law. A 2009 survey showed 8,000 workers in Wyoming make at or below the Federal minimum. \r\n\r\nThe root cause of many of these is Wyoming\u2019s conservative politics, where policy-makers deem mining and other corporate interests more important than improving the lives of those who are not wealthy or white. Wyoming is a right-to-work state with at-will employment, so anyone can be fired for any reason at any time. This results in unsafe, unfair workplaces, as workers fear for their jobs should they speak out. Immigrant workers often find themselves isolated in the state\u2019s far-flung rural communities.\r\n\r\nWyoming is largely rural and extremely conservative, with a few small cities and large towns. Because of this, many people who would be more active in our organization and our work face unique challenges, such as a lack of reliable or affordable transportation, fear of losing a job or of employer retaliation, social isolation, and language barriers. In Wyoming, merely providing a voice to workers, minorities, immigrants, and low-income people can change some power dynamics\r\n\r\nWe are building collective power among progressive organizations in the state, along with emerging American Indian and Latino/a organizations. By working together, we can achieve economies of scale and create a united front to push for legislative and policy changes that will benefit our constituents. We identify shared issues of concern, then come together either as formal coalitions (such as the one that held worker safety forums) or ad hoc (such as the organizations that did voter turnout on the Reservation). Our board has identified these areas that ESPC will focus on in the next several years as a way to maximize our collective reach and bring together organizations that can attain more as a group than separately.",

Our overall strategies are to educate the public through media and online communication, to empower and mobilize our supporters to speak out on these issues, and to pressure policymakers on specific solutions.\r\n\r\nOur communication strategy is an extension of what has been successful thus far. We use earned media, our web site, and our email alert list to communicate to the general public and to our supporters on specific issues. We also use our network of organizations to communicate to the larger progressive community in the state. Our web site is where we disseminate more detailed information, such as Fact Sheets, reports, and analysis. The alert list is where we send links to the web site, or other sources of information, and do our calls to action \u2013 whether that is contacting a legislator, attending a forum or committee meeting, or taking other steps. \r\n\r\nWe will also hold public forums around the state on specific topics, testify at legislative committee meetings, mobilize supporters, and reach out to affected populations.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, we have broken our work over the grant year into four areas. Specific goals and strategies for each area are in the chart below.\r\n\r\nWe will track the numeric objectives below and will follow-up with workshop attendees, particularly with immigrant attendees and work with them to organize to use the information to improve safety in their jobs. We will also track earned media coverage and online outreach numbers for reports and mobilization. In a state such as Wyoming, policy wins can be difficult to achieve; however, we will also look at feedback from our constituents, member agencies, and supporters.", 
    "narrative5": "In addition to working with ESPC member agencies in our ongoing work, we work in other coalitions. We work with many national and regional organizations on policy issues including: National Employment Law Project on unemployment insurance, minimum wage, and wage theft; Network United for Rural Voice and Cross Network Immigration to address immigration, employment, and health issues from a rural perspective; and National Council for Occupational Safety and Health (NCOSH) on worker safety issues, including Workers Memorial Day commemorations and job safety workshops. These organizations provide technical assistance and information on policy issues.\r\n\r\nFor worker safety, we have a statewide collaboration that includes ESPC, Wyoming Association of Churches, Wyoming State AFL-CIO, Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, and SAFER (Spence Association for Employee Rights). This group held a Know Your Rights workshop in Gillette last fall that more than 40 workers attended, many of them immigrants. With NCOSH, we plan to hold a Worker Safety and Health Training with those workers on June 15. \r\n \r\nIn Wyoming collaborations, we generally take a lead role; however, at times, we provide a conduit to our member agencies or offer policy help.\r\n\r\nAll of our collaborations work across constituency lines. For example, by involving the AFL-CIO and local unions with organizations such as the Association of Churches, which works with immigrants, in worker safety events and activities, we can bring a larger voice to the table than organizations working alone. ESPC has a long-standing collaboration with the Wind River Alliance, to engage American Indian youth in GOTV and other work on the reservation, including voter education and mobilization work in four reservation communities in election years. We also have partnered with the Casper Branch of the NAACP doing voter education and mobilization and citizen engagement work and issue education around Martin Luther King Day.",

The ESPC has a long history of working with people of color \u2013 in our Leadership Councils and on the Wind River Reservation \u2013 not to \u201chelp\u201d them but to address institutional problems and assist them in finding their voice. Bringing in minority and low-income organizations and voices to our coalition and to the public discourse will effect change, both in policy and in how some organizations work on those policies.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with our member agency Wyoming Equality on LGBTQ issues. In the 2013 Legislature, we worked with them on domestic partnerships and nondiscrimination legislation. \r\n\r\nThe ESPC is a primarily-white-led organization; however, we have a long history of working with communities of color in the state.\r\n\r\nWe work with people on the Wind River Reservation, including Unity, the Northern Arapaho and the Shoshone tribal liaisons to the Governor\u2019s office, and many others. One project ESPC has been involved with for several years is the Native American Pathways program with the University of Illinois Medical School at Rockford, in partnership with the Kellogg Foundation, to provide ways for Native youth to access health care careers. In addition, we have done extensive voter outreach and education on the reservation, including a very successful drive just over a year ago as part of a contested County Commissioner election that resulted in the re-election of a Native commissioner in Fremont County and our turnout work in 2012 (described above).\r\n\r\nESPC also works with Latino groups in Torrington and Rock Springs. Our long-term plan is for these Leadership Councils to grow into their own entities and join out coalition as full member agencies. Our group in Torrington has addressed discrimination at the local community college, at the local cemetery, and \u2013 this spring \u2013 in a local water and sewer district election. The election was not conducted in compliance with state election law and disenfranchised a number of voters, including Latino voters, resulting in losses by candidates from the Latino community. ESPC connected the group to the Wyoming ACLU and helped collect affidavits and evidence. Candidates and residents of the district filed a petition in the 8th Judicial District Court to challenge the election. The case is pending. \r\n\r\nAll of this work is connected. Discrimination against LGBTQ people or against racial or ethnic minorities or against the working poor is at the core of our policy work.

    "narrative3": "Problems and Root Causes:  \r\nEnvironmental Degradation - When Europeans immigrated to this land they found pristine ecosystems, teeming with biodiversity. Humans lived in balance with nature in environmentally sustainable, egalitarian, mostly matrilineal indigenous societies without the social ills of western society such as prisons. The ravenous appetite of the invaders demanded control over natural and cultural resources, beginning the destruction of ecosystems immediately upon contact. Indigenous systems quickly broke down like a wave across the land from the East to the West coast. Today, indigenous peoples are disproportionally affected by climate change, as people who still live off the land to varying degrees and many reservations suffer toxic pollution. Changing water quality, temperatures and levels, pollution and diminishing forests, wildlife, fish and traditional foods are causing great harm to indigenous peoples today. \r\nLack of EJ/ Sustainability movement - The majority of Native people lack resources and knowledge to combat the effects of climate change. Tribes often have assimilated Council members who lack a critical analysis of destructive systems and are doing their best to address the critical needs of tribal members after decades of poverty. Northwest Native young adults on reservation are disproportionately affected by social and economic problems. Urban Natives struggle to understand how to honor traditions and exercise their sovereignty as both citizens of their Nations (or not) and living in cities as POC. They often lack opportunities for culturally appropriate learning, vehicles for organizing and meaningful interaction with progressive networks working for social justice. \r\nDirect Action:  There exists a very small but growing movement in Northwest Indian Country mostly focused around food sovereignty. Ya-howt participants will gain the necessary knowledge and skills to build this movement and will envision, plan and organize direct action for policy changes when needed, and lead community projects in environmental restoration, food security/justice/sovereignty, coops, natural building and renewable energy. We plan to organize at least two actions in year one in one of the above areas of sustainability. \r\n\r\nTMF Building Collective Power for Change:  What we have learned over the past five years of planning and community organizing for environmental justice and advancing sustainability is our unique role. As a Native nonprofit, TMF cannot directly advocate to Councils to make policy or appropriation changes. We also do not have to follow federal guidelines or bureaucratic systems like tribes. We listen to and follow direction of community constituents. We agitate for change by providing the tools and resources young (and Elder) change agents need to organize in their tribal communities, whether reservation or urban. \r\n\r\n",

Workshops begin with foundational education about areas and issues of Indigenous EJ/sustainability, building on knowledge as led by participants. We know Ya-howt is successful when the learning naturally progresses and develops into specific strategies for action where participants exhibit their knowledge, skills and leadership. Evaluation will be qualitative as well as quantitative with the 3 objectives listed above.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Ya-howt works directly with partner organizations in our EJ/sustainability work. Community Alliance for Global Justice shares their expertise in food justice with our participants. We plan to engage them in at least 2-3 more workshops each year focusing on how to combat food injustices and empower us with tools to create new solutions\u2013 both in a rural setting and within Seattle urban Indian communities. Learning from this collaboration will allow Ya-howt participants to develop a broad critical analysis of the industrial food system, how low income communities are impacted by poor health, and ways to control our food supply and our own health. \r\n\r\nYa-howt collaborates with the Northwest Indian College\u2019s Traditional Foods and Plants Program. In September 2013, our teachers/organizers will be certified by this program so we can offer credit for our Ya-howt community workshops. This will enable participants to acquire certifications (and potentially degrees over time) in areas of sustainability and environmental studies. In addition, we access traditional ecological knowledge and cultural keepers from the college network of incredible teachers that share their knowledge. Certifications and degrees will allow participants to attract funding and other support for their projects and could enable them to potentially get jobs in the shifting economy.\r\n\r\nTierra Madre ccoordinates Northwest training opportunities for certifications in Indigenous natural/green building. www.sustainablenations.org\r\n\r\n\r\nCollaborations are important not just to acquire knowledge, but to also inform the non-native organizations in TEK as well, deepening the EJ movement. Newly acquired knowledge and skills will assist Ya-howt participants as they move from knowledge into action for sustainable change.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Fighting racism is at the core of Indigenous environmental justice work. Included in Ya-howt curriculum is a critical analysis of how Native communities have been disproportionately targeted by industry as toxic dumpsites and home to all facets of the fossil fuel extractive industry processes \u2013 from mining to refineries.  Mainstream systems and industries\u2019 mistreatment of Native Americans is a complex issue, stemming from the federal government\u2019s roles as \u201ctrustees\u201d over Nations, to a lack of political power, to being isolated in rural and remote locations with little access to capital or markets. \r\n\r\nOur goal for urban Native participants is to chart a path for themselves that will empower their unique role as an Indigenous person operating within a society still mostly dominated by white values and institutions. An example of the unique perspective a Native person brings to a process: one of our teachers was involved with a mainstream environmental organization with a purpose of designing rain gardens to reduce toxic runoff into Puget Sound. In the planning process, she was able to convince the planning team of the importance of researching the history and cultural significance of this particular area of Seattle. In their research, they discovered that this area was an important salmon spawning area and a Duwamish village site that served as a summer trading spot. The many tributary streams and wetlands made up a system ideal for spawning and for juvenile salmon to grow. This knowledge completely changed the project focus into simply constructing rain gardens, into organizing the neighborhood in cultural and environmental regeneration of the water systems in this neighborhood to resemble its important role in the area. \r\n\r\nFor reservation-based participants, our goal for them is to design a community organizing pathway that will begin or add to an environmental justice and sustainable community systems design and policies to compliment them. We find that tribal communities mostly support EJ and sustainable projects, but lack resources to implement them given the many pressing needs of reservation communities. Native Nations need to begin to assert their treaty rights over their ceded lands for the health of whole ecosystems and communities. Participants will examine the ways in which many Tribal governments, due to the legacies of colonialism, have mirrored mainstream policies when they do not have to! \r\n\r\nFor both constituencies, alliances with like-minded organizations are key to success. Building local power is essential to breaking through racism for mutually beneficial community projects designed to clean-up toxins, protect existing natural/cultural resources and to build new systems with renewable energy and protections for native plants and foods. \r\n",

The newspaper has proven to be a dual force for social change \u2013 providing an immediate and dignified income opportunity while impacting public policy through reporting on many issues that are often ignored by traditional media.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper is published biweekly and is distributed by low-income vendors who purchase the paper for $.25 and resell it in the community for $1.00.  Selling over 20,000 newspapers each month, it has earned a reputation as a leader in social justice media and as a very real force in the public process. \r\n\r\nSome of Street Roots\u2019 accomplishments are:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAfter a year of working with Multnomah County and the Medical Examiner to collect data pertaining to deaths among people experiencing homelessness, the first homeless deaths report, \u201cDomicile Unknown,\u201d was published last spring.

After years of experiencing a recession and declining revenues, governments have trimmed their budgets to the extreme.  Continuing to tighten these budgets doesn\u2019t make them more efficient but rather eliminates programs, which provide a necessary safety net in our society.\r\n\r\nThe current economic crisis disproportionally affects women, veterans, individuals with disabilities and communities of color.  Policy leaders continue to make choices that support big businesses and wealthy individuals through a broken tax code, inadequate health care and bailouts for corporations while eliminating support to individuals in need.\r\nNo one is affected more by extreme poverty and the lack of social supports than a person living without a home. Addressing the needs of the homeless is critical, but continuing to wait until they reach the crisis point of homelessness is a cycle that diverts precious time and energy from seeking long-term solutions.\r\n\r\nStreet Roots is effective in its efforts due to its unique role in the community.

As stated by Marc Jolin, Executive Director of JOIN, \u201cStreet Roots is a critical ally in the systems change work that is happening in our community.  Not only do they provide first-rate news coverage of important issues that impact low-income and homeless residents of Portland, they are at the table and a thoughtful voice in the hard conversations about how we can better meet the needs of people living in poverty.\u201d \r\n\r\nStreet Roots educates and engages the larger Portland community when over 15,000 readers read the news, information, and interviews published in the newspaper, as well as important perspectives from those living in poverty.  It provides an opportunity to use investigative journalism and take a multifaceted look at an issue and expose the inequities.  The editorial component is used to propose solutions.  The base of like-minded organizations and individual readers is used to put pressure on public officials to make changes, both through direct requests to policy makers and by actively working to show support.  Our role as a newspaper allows us to be responsive to emerging issues as well as take intentional steps toward long-term goals.  This strategy has allowed Street Roots to make tangible change at multiple levels \u2013 from saving individuals and families from homelessness to restoring and creating funding streams for housing and homeless services.\r\n\r\nEven more important are the human connections that are made between readers and someone living in extreme poverty. Those human connections allow us to build a cross-class movement that will humanize individuals living on the streets and shift budget priorities, create new funding streams, and replace punitive policies with ones that are constructive, proactive, and humane.  \r\n",

    "narrative1": "Since 1998, Street Roots newspaper has been an award-winning publication filled with in-depth investigative reporting on a wide range of issues typically not covered by other news organizations.  Focusing on poverty and homelessness, it has emerged as an influential voice in the public process, ready to identify creative solutions and move them forward. The newspaper has proven to be a dual force for social change \u2013 providing an immediate and dignified income opportunity while impacting public policy through reporting on many issues that are often ignored by traditional media.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper is published biweekly and is distributed by low-income vendors who purchase the paper for $.25 and resell it in the community for $1.00.  Selling over 20,000 newspapers each month, it has earned a reputation as a leader in social justice media and as a very real force in the public process. \r\n\r\nSome of Street Roots\u2019 accomplishments are:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAfter a year of working with Multnomah County and the Medical Examiner to collect data pertaining to deaths among people experiencing homelessness, the first homeless deaths report, \u201cDomicile Unknown,\u201d was published last spring.

    "narrative3": "Street Roots\u2019 core mission is to address the issues of poverty and homelessness.  After years of experiencing a recession and declining revenues, governments have trimmed their budgets to the extreme.  Continuing to tighten these budgets doesn\u2019t make them more efficient but rather eliminates programs, which provide a necessary safety net in our society.\r\n\r\nThe current economic crisis disproportionally affects women, veterans, individuals with disabilities and communities of color.  Policy leaders continue to make choices that support big businesses and wealthy individuals through a broken tax code, inadequate health care and bailouts for corporations while eliminating support to individuals in need.\r\nNo one is affected more by extreme poverty and the lack of social supports than a person living without a home. Addressing the needs of the homeless is critical, but continuing to wait until they reach the crisis point of homelessness is a cycle that diverts precious time and energy from seeking long-term solutions.\r\n\r\nStreet Roots is effective in its efforts due to its unique role in the community.  The newspaper engages readers across issues, highlighting the common threads while offering multiple perspectives.

Incarceration rates disproportionately affect people of color.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStreet Roots provided a platform for local activist Jo Ann Hardesty to review a recent audit of the Portland Police Bureau and call for a true examination of the civil rights violations committed by the bureau. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe paper featured an interview with racial and LGBT rights activist Kathleen Sadat as she reflected on her career when retiring as the diversity development/affirmative action manager for the City of Portland.  She used the interview to give her perspective on where to go with the fight for social justice.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStreet Roots is publishing an ongoing series of poems from the Native American Youth and Family Center that provides a voice for the youth of the organization.  \r\n\r\nOn a more personal level, we ask vendors, staff, and volunteers to abide by five simple principles: no physical violence, no verbal violence, no sexism, no racism, and no homophobia.  Although these principles really apply to general respect, they spell out clearly that sexist, racist, or homophobic comments won\u2019t be tolerated.  We strive to create an empowering environment.  It\u2019s important that we provide a safe container so that all people feel empowered.\r\n",

Our mission is to help people with disabilities protect their legal and human rights through free advocacy and legal services.  Our strategies are teaching and organizing people with disabilities to advocate for themselves, supporting self-determination, independence, dignity, and choice, while also providing individual and systemic advocacy and legal representation.  Since 1977, DRI has worked with people with disabilities to change public policy allowing people with disabilities access to mainstream education, move out of large public institutions into the community setting of their choice, protect the rights of parents with disabilities (a model for other states recently cited in a report by the President\u2019s National Council on Disabilities), prohibit the involuntary sterilization of adults and children with disabilities, and many other cases on an individual basis helping people with disabilities address denials of services or benefits, disability discrimination, denials of access to public education, and more.  Much of our work focuses on collaborating with other organizations in educating people with disabilities and allies on how to advocate for themselves, including training on how to speak to legislators, the public policy process, and direct self-advocacy strategies.  DRI is also a SOAR organization, helping people with disabilities who are homeless or at risk of homelessness obtain Social Security Disability benefits they otherwise are unable to access, and use those benefits to secure housing.    Another program we operate is the work incentives program, helping people with disabilities get accurate information on how to keep their benefits safety net in place while helping them learn to navigate the employment services network to obtain employment.  Beneficiaries are taught how to advocate for themselves and what to do when dealing with Social Security and other government agencies.",

    "narrative3": "DRI collaborates with the Idaho Homeless Coalition and other organizations that provide assistance to Idahoans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  Estimates of Idaho\u2019s homeless population in 2013 is 1,781 men, women and children ( we believe this number is greatly underestimated due to the methodology \u2013 counting how many people access Idaho\u2019s shelters at one given point in time during the fiscal year).  Many of these individuals have disabilities that prevent them from obtaining education, training or employment, or accessing social services that can help them get food, shelter and medical care.   Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income, along with Medicare and Medicaid, were established to provide safety nets to people with disabilities who were unable to work for at least 1 year due to their disability.  People who are homeless are often unable to access these benefits due to their disability, inability to access medical care and/or get medical documentation of their disability due to their homelessness and frequent relocation.  If they have been able to get disability benefits, they often lose them once they lose access to a bank account and physical address.  If homeless people with disabilities are lucky enough to have found a way to get and keep their benefits, they are often discouraged by social services, organizations, well meaning friends, and others, from finding employment for fear of losing their hard won benefits.  All of these barriers combine to keep people with disabilities from obtaining stable shelter and a living wage.  These issues are addressed by the SOAR Advocate who assists people with disabilities to obtain their disability benefits, access medical care and records, and provides information/education on self-advocacy, including referrals other agencies, to stabilize the person\u2019s/family\u2019s situation.  Once the person's housing is stabilized, DRI\u2019s community work incentives coordinator (CWIC) provides information, planning and assistance on how Social Security work incentives can be used to protect disability benefits and medical coverage until the person can work at a level that provides independence and stability.  DRI's certified CWIC, one of only 3 actively working in Idaho, provides detailed benefits counseling and information, working with the client to access training and rehabilitation to get back to work in the employment field of their choice.  The SOAR and WIPA programs together create a continuum of assistance in self-advocacy that helps people with disabilities who are homeless access necessary income and medical care to stabilize their situation for the long term instead of a temporary fix that ensures they continue to live in poverty.  People with disabilities are empowered to achieve independence, and advocate for themselves while keeping necessary services in place to ensure they do not return to homelessness.. ",

    "narrative4": "Our overall goal is to help people with disabilities who are homeless develop a long term solution to homelessness, as well as providing the tools and access to employment services to address chronic poverty experienced by many people with disabilities.  The first step is to hire one full time advocate and one half time community work incentives coordinator to make up for the staffing shortage DRI has had over the past 2 years due to budget cuts and delays in funding by Congress' tardiness in passing continuing resolutions/budgets for government funded services.  Both staff will have to receive significant training on disability language and etiquette, diversity training, and training in the respective programs.  Once the training and certifications are complete, the new hires will undergo a period of on the job training, shadowing experienced staff on outreach and education campaigns, eventually obtaining their own caseloads.  Extensive outreach and collaboration with appropriate organizations will be necessary (Idaho Homeless Coalition, Idaho Department of Health & Welfare, Social Security Administration, etc. - see below), as well as outreach into Idaho's underserved communities in rural areas, the Latino community, Refugee communities, and the Native American reservation lands.  Data will be tracked using DRI's two databases (DAD for SOAR, and ETO for WIPA) to determine whether objectives are being met, as well as the client demographics to ensure outreach is effective in reaching Idaho's unserved or underserved populations.  Outcomes will be tracked long term to evaluate whether we are getting clients off the streets and into stable living environments, as well as whether they are able to be gainfully employed.  Data will be reported to our federal funding agencies as well as to SJF in our final report.", 
    "narrative5": "DRI is a lead organization of the Consortium of Idahoans with Disabilities (CID), a coalition of 25+ organizations who are led by and/or work with people with disabilities throughout the state.  In partnership with CID, DRI has  introduced public policies such as moving people with disabilities out of state institutions into the community of their choice, prohibiting the involuntary sterilization of adults and children with disabilities without due process of law, helped mobilize hundreds of people with disabilities to testify to the Idaho Legislature against drastic Medicaid cuts, and, this past year, requiring people who are seeking to be guardians or conservators of people with disabilities to undergo criminal and financial background checks to reduce the abuse and financial exploitation of people with disabilities.  DRI also collaborates with the Idaho Self-Advocates Leadership Network (SALN), an organization run by, and for, adults with developmental disabilities.  SALN now has 4 chapters around the state, and will soon be adding a 5th.  DRI works with SALN to promote awareness about adults with developmental disabilities, serves in an advisory capacity on SALN\u2019s Board of Directors, provides support to self-advocates at SALN\u2019s Leadership Conference (all presenters at the conference must be self-advocates \u2013 people with disabilities), and recently, collaborated with SALN, the Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities and Idaho Legal Aid Services to apply for a grant to address domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking of people with disabilities (pending).  Work with both of these organizations provides an opportunity to empower people with disabilities to organize and speak out about public policy issues that impact their lives, inform DisAbility Rights Idaho and public policy makers about the priorities of people with disabilities, and direct our work in responding to the needs of the disability community in challenging abuse, exploitation, and discrimination in Idaho.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "DRI is historically a white-led organization, reflecting the demographics of Idaho (83.6% white per 2011 U.S. Census figures; Idaho\u2019s next largest ethnic population is Hispanic/Latinos at 11.5%).  However, this is changing.  DisAbility Rights Idaho is building the diversity of its staff (2 Latinas; 2 LGBTQ folks; some low income; many over age 55; both rural and urban staff, etc.).  DRI's Board is now 31% people of color.  People of color are also obtaining positions of leadership \u2013 DRI\u2019s Advocacy Director is Latina, and the incoming Board President is an African American woman.  DRI\u2019s Advocacy Director is heavily involved in social justice and racial issues, and often represents DRI in collaborations with reproductive, racial and social justice organizations in Idaho and throughout the Pacific Northwest.  \r\n\r\nDRI is also moving forward in addressing disability issues within the LGBTQ community.  DRI Senior Advocate, Mel Leviton, recently presented at a national LGBTQ Conference in Atlanta, GA, on a panel discussing the intersection of disability and sexuality in the LGBTQ community (sexuality and disability are rarely discussed, and gay sex and disability is NEVER discussed!)  There were over 6,500 attendees at the conference, and the discussion was well received.  It is hoped that this topic will be addressed at disability focused conferences in the future.  \r\n\r\nAbleism (discrimination based on disability), racism, economic injustice, homophobia, and other forms of oppression all intersect.  People with disabilities can be from any race or ethnicity, gay or straight, rich or poor, although most often live in poverty.  People with disabilities are often oppressed within these groups, being a minority within a minority, in which oppression and discrimination are compounded.  They are often the last to get hired, have the poorest economic outcomes and least access to social safety nets, are denied basic human rights outlawed decades ago for other populations, and are denied basic human dignity and decision making power over their own bodies.  DRI works with organizations in Idaho to educate people on the intersectionality of disability and race, disability and sexuality, and disability and economic rights. Much of our outreach focuses on Idaho's communities of color, which typically have a higher incidence of disability than the white population, and the least access to  services either due to language barriers, or due to the mistrust of \"white\" social services.  During the past several years, DRI's assistance has increased in Idaho's Hispanic/Latino Communities, Refugee communities and Native American communities, as well as collaborating with organizations led by people of color, such as public policy and reproductive justice work with the Women of Color Alliance, and providing voters rights training to the Idaho Community Action Network, as well as collaborating with ICAN on Medicaid issues.

They have the least access to medical care, despite being the most in need of medical services.  These safety nets are largely unavailable to people who are homeless.  People with disabilities who are also homeless face additional barriers in that they often cannot even apply for Social Security benefits because they do not have access to a computer to apply, or do not have access to transportation to their nearest Social Security office, which may be in another city or county.  Due to their transient situation, people with disabilities who are homeless often do not have access to the medical documentation needed to support a disability application, or are unable to navigate the system at all due to their disability.  If they can get benefits, they are discouraged from seeking the stability and additional income employment can provide for fear of losing their benefits, or may try to access work without accurate information and lose the medical services that allow them to work in the first place.  DRI's SOAR and WIPA programs provide a continuum of assistance in helping people with disabilities who are homeless obtain an income, housing and medical care, and accurate information needed to achieve further independence and stability by accessing work incentives to protect benefits while they see if they can work at a level that allows them to be independent from government benefits and maintain stable shelter.  This creates a permanent fix to homelessness for people with disabilities, as well as an opportunity to  obtain an increased income to supplement their benefits, or hopefully receive employment training to work at a higher income.",

As a group of farmworker women we will strengthen our pride, our dignity and advance our cause.\r\n\r\n(History)\r\n\r\nMujeres Luchadoras Progresistas (Women Striving for Progress) began as a project of PCUN, Oregon\u2019s farmworker union, in 1992 and incorporated as a non-profit in 2001 to foster the organization\u2019s development and self-determination. In 1992, PCUN\u2019s service center noticed a marked increase in women members who were reporting domestic violence, sexual harassment in the workplace, and other problems. There were no agencies or organizations in the community that addressed the root causes of women\u2019s oppression: economic inequity and dependence. In order to address these issues at their source, and the system that perpetuates these conditions, farmworker women need support from their peers. \r\n\r\n(Accomplishments)\r\n\r\n*We have two MLP members that serve as programming assistant and producer for our weekly radio show in 2012.\r\n\r\n*Last year \u201cThe Wreath Project\u201d  was able to involve five additional women for a total of sixteen. Despite the continued economic crises, we sold an additional 100 wreaths than the year before for a total of $25,900.\r\n\r\n* MLP collaborated with twelve organizations to the voice of women on social justice issues like: Health Care for Immigrants,  Driver\u2019s License Restoration, Wage theft, and Immigration reform.\r\n\r\n*We were able to organize 8 new MLP members and their families and brought awareness to over 150 families through community forums, house visits and workshops.",

Women continue to be victims of domestic violence, at work harassment and social injustice (lack of access to driver's license, in-access to health care, etc.). \r\n\r\n(Root causes of the issues)\r\n\r\nThe lack of education and economic power (or independence) for farmworker-immigrant women has rendered a systematic imbalance of justice. Women who face economic dependence on their partners, are susceptible to stay in abusive relationships. Weak wage theft and labor laws leave farmworkers, especially women susceptible to abuse from their employers, who stay due to lack of other viable employment alternatives (due to immigrant status or educational background).\r\n\r\n(Collective power?)\r\n\r\nAs a small grassroots organization we build collective power by building a grassroots volunteer base that organize our education forums, \"The Wreath Project\", radio program, and make up our board.  We collaborate with larger organizations, such as Causa Oregon, PCUN, to shape policies and campaigns that affect our members, such as driver's license restoration, health care access.\r\n\r\nWe utilize a radio program to disseminate information and mobilize women in the community (who don't have access to the internet or cell phones)\r\n\r\nWe hold community forums that educate and lead the community to invest in our many programs that empower and educate (The Wreath Project, radio program, etc), we organize house visits, we offer workshops, and we offer political action opportunities, whether its talking to our elected leaders in the capitol, or organizing and assisting with the Salem (Oregon) May Day Rally.\r\n\r\n(How will our work change...)\r\n\r\nWe must keep in mind that we are working with some of the most oppressed members in our community as they have feel safer in the shadows that have made them prisoners of injustice because of their immigration, educational background, or economic status.\r\n\r\nWe try to address barriers of access to education by broadcasting our \u201cMLP Mujeres de la Comunidad\u201d radio broadcast which provides a mobile and audible way of obtaining the educational information that MLP sees as basic and vital in preparing women and introducing social justice awareness to the community in an unrestricted form. \r\n\r\nThe forums provide the same access to information in a more social environment and family friendly way. \r\n\r\nOur house visits are used to tackle more taboo issues in a more private and safe place that a friend or neighbor\u2019s home brings. \r\n\r\nWe utilize \"The Wreath Project\" as an opportunity for our women to view themselves as entrepreneurs. Involved with the planning, execution, and evaluation of the program. This program has led women to become confident in starting their own entrepreneurial enterprises. ",

It was difficult to ignore the correlation between the economic dependence of women with either their partner/spouse or their employer and their heightened vulnerability to abuse and willingness to endure.\r\n\r\nOur programs our aimed to making the women we serve to learn about their rights via radio, forums, workshops, and house visits. We hope that through these efforts women can feel safe and empowered to make a decision to participate in The Wreath Project. Through the wreath project we hope women realize that though they may lack a high school or college education, they have the capacity to start their own business. The wealth project ultimately offers women confidence to take the next step to venture in their own entrepreneurial dream.\r\n\r\nWith their own business, comes their own income; with their own income, comes their own independence. With their own independence comes their own self-determination to avoid staying in worksites that exploit their workers or staying in abusive relationships at home. It is in this respect, that our organization is involved in the work of economic justice.\r\n\r\nOur programs are not a replacement for formal education, but offer a viable option for low-income farmworker Latinas (some with an immigrant status) to realize their own economic potential but also express their political voice to shape their own destiny.",

This project is well aligned with SAN\u2019s mission, which is to minimize the impact of, and maximize awareness about, AIDS and other consequences of HIV infection in the Inland Northwest.  Social injustice is a leading cause of HIV. SAN's Prevention program, Inland Northwest Men's Experience (INMx), is funded by the Washington State Department of Health. INMx empowers at-risk community members by providing them with the tools they need to combat a variety of factors that contribute to HIV among young MSM.  In 2009, SAN started a testing program through a 12-month grant provided by the Pride Foundation. After this grant cycle,  SAN has been able to continue funding testing through other means and testing services are provided to this day. SAN\u2019s HIV testing counselor visits twice a month to offer free HIV testing to group participants.  Through successful publicity efforts, we have been able to increase testing to at-risk individuals by nearly 50 percent.  Because the program works with people who may have had significant life struggles, one INMx coordinator is trained in suicide prevention, and efforts are underway to train another.   ",

    "narrative3": "INMx acknowledges that basic sex education is not enough to prevent the spread of HIV. Instead, we must also look at the social factors associated with the risky situations men continue to put themselves in. Preventing HIV begins with each individual\u2019s self-confidence and knowledge. INMx works to promote safer sex, healthy lifestyles, and healthy relationships. This triad of education is necessary to successfully influence a population and minimize their risk factors. It begins with our sex positive methods of educating young gay and bi men which engages them and encourages learning. After educating the group, we focus on providing them with the skills they need to negotiate safer sex and practice their gained knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that a variety of factors put young people at risk for HIV and we address these issues. One risk factor is low self-esteem. INMx combats this with a prominent ongoing message of self-love as well as hosting events with the specific intent of promoting self-love through self-exploration. Another risk factor is the misuse of drugs and alcohol. INMx hosts events that are designed to educate young people about ways to reduce their risk for HIV while engaging in these activities. One of the most common causes of risky behaviors is a lack of communication skills. With a series of role-play based events, INMx prepares individuals to diffuse the message of safer sex with their friends, their partners, and their peer circles.\r\n\r\nInformal outreach is a very heavy focus of INMx. By informing our members to spread the knowledge they obtain, we are able to reach beyond our direct audience and expose the community to both information about the project and information about sexual health. From social media sites like Facebook and twitter, to discussions with peers in coffee houses, we prepare our members to spread the knowledge they gain at INMx. By targeting 10% of the population with formal outreach, we are able to branch out to the larger community through informal outreach. This tiered distribution of knowledge allows us to develop a collective power and promote an important message of self-love and sexual health. \r\n\r\nAt INMx, we believe sexual health and HIV prevention extends farther than the distribution of condoms. By analyzing the root problems that our population is facing, we are able to assist them in making healthier choices with their sex lives. We dig much deeper than the materials and we work to enhance the overall quality of life of the members that we work with so they are more capable to discuss sexual health with the people in their lives.

First, we will pursue a project space that can comfortably accommodate 24 people (or 150% of our current project space.) Our next goal is to develop the project space into a culturally competent and diverse atmosphere. To accomplish this, we will have a diverse focus group of 10 people that will discuss ways to represent differences in the project space.  The core group will then look into d\u00e9cor, furniture, media resources, sexual health messaging, advertisements, and project materials. We will then purchase the furnishings, d\u00e9cor, and necessities suggested to diversify the project space. Our next goal is to develop a diverse marketing plan. This will begin with another diverse focus group of 10 people which will look at the graphics, photos, and the text on the marketing to ensure that the marketing campaign is diverse and culturally competent. We will publish, print, and distribute the marketing materials using traditional channels such as local restaurants and health departments as well as publishing marketing materials specifically designed to diversify our social media presence\r\n\r\nAfter implementation of this plan, we will use a some tools for assessment.

INMx works with OYC to provide workshops and HIV testing outreach to the youth. This partnership allows us to bridge the gap between the youth of OYC and the young adults of INMx. In order to prevent the spread of HIV in a nation we must collaborate with other organizations to affect a much larger population. OutSpokane is another very strong community partner of INMx. OutSpokane focuses on the promotion of equality among the LGBTQA community. INMx works directly with OutSpokane on events such as Spokane\u2019s annual Pride Festival which draws approximately 5,200 people. This partnership is important because the missions of INMx and OutSpokane are closely related. HIV thrives in marginalized societies. While OutSpokane is fighting for equality they are providing support for marginalized populations. Working with them allows us to broaden our fight against HIV in the community.  We also have a partnership with the LGBT Center.  Since 2009, we partnered with the LGBT Center to share a project space.

While INMx is only funded to provide services to white MSM, we never turn people from other backgrounds away.  Instead, we seek support to accommodate all who can benefit from our program.  Attendees specifically benefit by having a safe place for other young gay and bisexual men to meet and converse with peers. This project focuses on building the confidence of young men through safer sex negotiation skills, education, and workshops about healthy relationships. The skills INMx offers are designed to propel a community member to function successfully in a world that may be afraid of their sexual orientation. INMx also addresses homophobia through education. By educating the homosexual community and the greater public about prevalence of homophobia, we raise awareness and reduce the effect of homophobia on the community. By reducing segregation and homophobia in the Inland Northwest, we are working to reduce HIV among vulnerable people.",

As the decision-making body of INMx, this group focuses directly on diffusing behaviors through social networks. INMx succeeds at HIV prevention because we focus on the social aspects of HIV. Because the decision making body consists of peers directly affected by the issues that INMx faces, we are able to influence a larger population with informal outreach and education. 25% of our dedicated core leaders are also HIV+, meaning they are directly affected by the issues INMx addresses. This diversity keeps us honest and accountable to the populations we serve. ",

    "narrative1": "The mission of the Transit Riders Union is to build a participatory democratic union of transit riders fighting for better public transit. We are working and poor people, mostly dependent on public transit. We recognize that recent cuts to transit systems across the county are part of a bigger picture of rising inequality and a decades-long assault on our standard of living, and that ultimately only a movement of working and poor people united across racial and other divides can turn the tide. TRU aims to contribute to this movement.\r\n\r\nTRU grew out of a successful campaign to save Metro service from 17% cuts in summer 2011. We became a membership organization in June 2012, and our first major campaign protested the elimination of the downtown Ride Free Area, which thousands of low-income riders depended on for mobility and to access services. We gathered 3000 petition signatures and organized a \u201cfuneral march\u201d of 200 transit riders. Although we couldn't save the RFA, our demonstration of the hardship caused by its elimination directly influenced the King County Council's decision to consider a low income reduced fare.\r\n\r\nBus fares in King County have risen 80% since 2008, and since our foundation TRU members wanted to campaign for a low income fare. We now have a representative on the King County Low Income Options Advisory Committee, which will make recommendations to the County Council in July 2013.\r\n\r\nWe are again facing the prospect of deep service cuts in 2014. Working with a neighborhood group fighting to restore their evening bus service, we organized a \u201cMidnight March for Metro\u201d in April 2013 to demonstrate the effects of cuts on our communities: transit riders, including senior and disabled riders, end up having to walk miles up steep hills late at night to get home.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Our work addresses the defunding and dismantling of public transit systems that has intensified in the past decade; the shift toward running public transit as a business that serves only those who can afford to pay rather than a public good that benefits everyone; the displacement of low income and people of color communities by poorly-designed transit-oriented development (e.g. around new light rail stations). Our work addresses the day-to-day problems that people who depend on public transit face: how to get to work and school, medical appointments and grocery stores, how to budget for bus fare and other necessities, how much time they have to spend struggling to get from here to there instead of with friends and family.\r\n\r\nThe root causes of these issues are Washington State\u2019s regressive tax system \u2013 the worst in the country \u2013 and the decades-long rise in wealth and power inequality in the United States.  The labor unions and community organizations that once were an organized voice for many (though not all) working and poor people have declined to a historically low level, and more and more people are isolated and unengaged, struggling alone. Working and poor people today are often essentially voiceless in determining the public policies and planning processes that affect their lives. We can\u2019t expect local and state governments and agencies to reform themselves, because they are under pressure from powerful moneyed interests that, for example, prioritize the building of new highways over expanding public transit.\r\n\r\nTRU believes that the answer to these root problems is grassroots organization. We aim to build collective power by growing our membership, teaching ourselves to make democratic decisions and to become effective organizers and leaders. We aim to forge ties with all neighborhoods in Seattle and King County by holding public meetings and working with aligned organizations. A vital piece of this picture is education, and we are developing materials explaining public transit issues and relating them to the bigger picture of economic injustice; we plan to give workshops to give communities the tools they need to organize around transit justice, and we will share these materials with the diverse organizations we work with, from transportation and urban planning-focused non-profits to organizations representing seniors, people with disabilities, immigrants and refugees, religious organizations, students, community organizations, and racial, social, and economic justice organizations.\r\n\r\nBy organizing ourselves as working and poor people in an powerful democratic union, we will build the grassroots economic and political power needed to put pressure on elected officials to make public transit work for everyone, to transform our state\u2019s regressive tax system, and ultimately to change the power dynamics and achieve structural change by tipping the balance from money-power and to people-power.",

These goals are relatively straightforward: we will have met them if we succeed in preventing service cuts and win a low income fare. We anticipate having to launch a huge get-out-the-vote for a Motor Vehicle Excise Tax to fund transit in late 2013; however, even if this campaign fails it may be an important step towards fighting for more progressive transit funding in 2014 and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe project goal is to develop educational materials that TRU and other community groups can use to spread knowledge and discussion of public transit as a social and economic justice issue. We will assess our success by gathering feedback from allied organizations and transit riders.\r\n\r\nThe internal/organizational goals are: first (1), to grow TRU membership from 55 to over 200 members, with several aims in mind: (a) the greater our numbers the more people-power we have and the more effective we can be, (b) the larger our membership the more activities we can sustain with dues and the more directly accountable we will be to our membership rather than to funders, and (c) we intend to do focused recruiting in low-income, transit-dependent, and majority-people-of-color neighborhoods; and second (2), to develop from among our membership a strong core of committed organizers with diverse backgrounds and skills who can continue to build TRU and do the day-to-day work necessary to sustain a powerful grassroots organization. We will assess our success based our membership and organizer numbers and the proportion of members and organizers who are low-income, transit-dependent, and people of color.", 
    "narrative5": "In the less than one year since our first Membership Meeting the Transit Riders Union has been involved in several collaborations. In summer 2012 we joined a coalition to change Sound Transit\u2019s plans for its Northgate light rail station from development based around cars to transit, pedestrian and bicycle access. This effort succeeded in reducing parking garage spots and laying groundwork for a pedestrian bridge from Seattle Central Community College to the Northgate Transit Center.\r\nIn fall 2012 we collaborated with SHARE/WHEEL (a homeless-led organization that runs self-managed shelters and tent cities) on our Ride Free Area Funeral March, also supporting their effort to pressure the County Council to let them purchase enough reduced-rate bus tickets for their members to travel to shelters. SHARE/WHEEL brought members to our march and collected petition signatures. This demonstration of solidarity between transit riders and the homeless community was effective: SHARE/WHEEL was granted their requested bus tickets, and although the RFA was eliminated the County Council is pursuing the idea of a low income reduced fare.\r\nTRU\u2019s major collaborative effort so far, in which we have taken the leading role, is our campaign for a low income fare. We wrote a letter to the County Council in support of a strong program and built a coalition of 28 signatory organizations, including labor unions, low income and homeless organizations, religious organizations, environmental groups, and organizations representing people of color and immigrants. We continue to work with our coalition partners to win a low income fare, holding roundtable discussions, keeping them updated on the progress of the King County Low Income Options Advisory Committee, encouraging their members and constituents to submit public comment, and collaborating to gather petition signatures. If we succeed, this low income fare program will be a first for a large US city. ", 
    "narrative6": "Public transit is a perfect example of the intersection of racial injustice with economic injustice. People of color in Seattle and King County are disproportionately low income. Low income riders, in turn, disproportionately depend on public transit for basic mobility and are therefore the ones most hurt by service cuts and fare hikes. Furthermore, when transit service is cut it is usually not the rush-hour commuter runs used by better-off, majority white riders, but rather the all-day service and bus routes connecting diverse neighborhoods and widely dispersed locations that low-income, majority people-of-color riders depend on. The result is that people of color are disproportionately impacted by service cuts and fare hikes, which tend to widen the gaps of opportunity and privilege which have historically divided white people and people of color in this country.\r\n\r\nTRU aims to unite low income transit riders, both white and people of color, including immigrants, to fight for affordable, reliable and accessible public transit \u2013 both within our own democratic member-run union and by allying with organizations that represent communities of color. So far our membership is majority low income, but also majority white, so as of spring 2013 we have started to do focused recruiting in majority people-of-color neighborhoods such as Rainier Beach and Columbia City. We also intend to recruit bilingual organizers so that eventually TRU members who are not fluent in English can participate fully in our meetings and decision-making processes. TRU has already allied with organizations that represent communities of color, such as the Seattle-King County NAACP, Got Green, Casa Latina, and El Centro de la Raza, as well as unions such as UNITE HERE Local 8 that represent majority people-of-color workers. All of these groups are coalition partners in our campaign for a low income fare.\r\n\r\nPublic transit connects racial justice with economic injustice in a second respect: low-income and majority people-of-color neighborhoods are being \u201cgentrified\u201d in part because of development around new light rail stations and street car lines. Unfortunately this process began before TRU existed and is now well underway. However, we are close allies with organizations like Puget Sound Sage that continue to work to preserve affordable housing and retail/small business space in majority people of color neighborhoods where transit oriented development has led to increased property values and rents.\r\n\r\nCurrently TRU has four elected officers and all are white, so in that sense we are now a white-led organization, but as we expand our membership in majority people of color neighborhoods, and recruit and/or train from among our membership organizers and officers who are also people of color, we expect this to change.",

We believe that mobility should be considered a right, and as more and more working and poor people cannot afford to own cars, access to public transit is a straightforward matter of economic justice. Without reliable and affordable transportation, people cannot get to places of employment, social services, education, and to visit and care for friends and family. We become second-class citizens. Transportation in Seattle accounts for as much as 30% of a person\u2019s monthly take-home income, which is unaffordable for many; public transit should be an affordable alternative to driving, but dramatic fare increases are straining budgets that are already over-taxed for transit due to the regressive sales tax that currently constitutes the majority of Metro\u2019s funding. As low income and minority groups are pushed further out into the suburbs by rising property values, affordable, effective transit systems become even more important. TRU\u2019s work in fighting to prevent bus service cuts and to win a low income reduced fare is a vital part of the fight for economic transit justice.\r\n\r\nJust as important is our work in building a strong democratic union of working and poor people that can act in solidarity with other organizations fighting for economic justice, to push for the larger systemic changes that are ultimately needed.  We cannot change our state\u2019s regressive tax structure or make the economy work for everyone by fighting for public transit alone, but by forging strong alliances now with other groups and making ties within diverse communities we can lay foundations for the larger fights that will be necessary to resist austerity and turn the tide of inequality in the years ahead.",

Our progressive movement is based on inclusion, human rights, and participatory democracy, with the human dignity group (HDG) as its basic structure.

    "narrative3": "ROP\u2019s seeks to put rural communities at the center of the fight for economic justice with an aspirational view of the small town \u201cCommons.\u201d We use the phrase \u201cCommons\u201d to refer to public infrastructure like schools, libraries, and post offices, but also the viability of small town economies and basic community needs like social services, immigrant services, housing, and health care.\r\n\r\nROP began in the early 1990s as a \u201cFight the Right\u201d organization.  In 1992, the Right was using culture wars and wedge strategies to divide our communities and gain power. In 2013, the face of the Right in small town Oregon can be seen through Tea Party takeovers of local government, anti-immigrant rhetoric, \u201castroturf\u201d organizing to advance a neo-liberal, corporate economic agenda, and the further dismantling of public infrastructure, like the postal service and public schools.\r\n\r\nThe Citizens United ruling that corporations are people, bombardment with unlimited campaign spending in the 2012 Election, dismantling of the United States Postal Service (USPS), attempts to destabilize public unions, Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr.\u2019s statement that the Justice Department may not pursue criminal cases against big banks because it could destabilize the economy\u2026these are all symptoms of a long term agenda for corporate dominance of our politics, economy, and democracy.\r\n\r\nRural Oregon is on the front lines of the fallout and can be on the front lines of the struggle to redefine our economy.  ROP builds power by mobilizing dozens of human dignity groups and small town communities to push back with our own vision of economic justice and fairness. One example is our work with leaders in Oregon\u2019s smallest communities to defend small town Post Offices.\r\n\r\nThe Right has an anti-government, anti-worker agenda, and a multi-decade plan for eliminating our public postal service \u2013 and other public infrastructure \u2013 for privatization and corporate gain.  If successful, they would take down the 2nd largest employer in the country (after Walmart).  This is a public employer where 85% of staff have collective bargaining, 40% are women, 40% are people of color and 22% are veterans. Rural post offices are also crucial for the survival of small town communities.  \r\n\r\nROP\u2019s organizing uses rural post office organizing as a wedge against this corporate agenda from a very unanticipated constituency \u2013 the most rural towns in the state. Our small town post office work highlights the economic needs of the small communities and showcases the enormous mobilization power and impact of these same towns. In total, we reached out to 140 communities.  51 of those communities held local campaign activities \u2013 a huge and powerful base to mobilize for the next phase of ROP\u2019s small town economic justice organizing against corporate dominance.\r\n",

For example organized resistance to debt (1 in 10 mortgages have been in foreclosure at one time in some rural Oregon counties, and up to 20% of credit card debt is currently delinquent), and fighting resource extraction projects that risk environmental devastation, health impacts, and loss of identity in rural Oregon towns.\r\n\r\nROP will use three types of convenings to develop campaign plans:\r\no\tRural Caucus & Strategy Session: statewide convening of over 125 ROP/HDG leaders\r\no\tIn-community Living Room Conversations (LRCs): that deepen the connection between saving rural post offices, economic justice and Right-wing strategies to privatize our communities and defund government.  LRCs build analysis and develop local human dignity group economic justice organizing campaigns that respond to the opportunities and challenges of their particular community.  \r\no\tRegional Convenings that bring together HDGs from across the region to build relationships and develop shared strategy\r\n\r\nOur goal is to engage over 500 people in our convenings and work with 12 communities on local economic justice organizing campaigns.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "ROP believes in building an all-inclusive movement where personal relationships, shared struggle, and strategic collaboration build a shared agenda and bigger impact.  The following are several of the most significant collaborations for ROP.\r\n\r\nROP is a founding board member of Causa Immigrant Rights Organization and continues today on the board of directors.  We have a long-term relationship with Basic Rights Oregon.  These relationships allows deep partnerships that anticipate the use of wedges to divide identity groups and more creative, cooperative responses that magnify our collective strength.  For example, when ROP\u2019s hometown was challenged in 2008/2009 with two countywide anti-immigrant ballot measures, BRO and Causa stepped in dedicating huge resources, staff time, and campaign leadership to partner with ROP, eventually defeating both measures.  ROP has worked with BRO on the Our Towns campaign building towards a marriage equality ballot measure.  This spring, we partnered with Causa in coordinating the March for ONE Oregon that brought a 50-passenger bus on a 5 day trip through of Eastern Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, promoting immigration reform in key Congressional Districts.\r\n\r\nAnother collaboration is among organizations committed to preventing Wage Theft in Oregon.  The original members of the coalition are NW Workers Justice Project, PCUN, Oregon Center for Public Policy, Voz, and ROP.  That coalition has grown to over 20 groups and is currently working on legislation in the Oregon Legislature and educating workers on their rights.\r\n\r\nIn addition ROP is an active member of ACT for Justice and Dignity, a network of groups fighting police/ICE collaboration, and with the Rights Working Group.  All of these relationships ensure that ROP\u2019s rural strategies are in line with state and national goals to win victories for immigrants, LGBTQ people, and low-income people in Oregon and across the country.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "While our base has historically been representative of the whitest areas of a state in one of the whitest regions in the country, ROP has created a culture that prioritizes racial justice work and the leadership of organizations of color within the state.  We have developed strategic allied relationships with organizations of color in Oregon, such as CAUSA, PCUN, UNETE, Voz, Center for Intercultural Organizing, and APANO that create accountable and coordinated racial justice work.  Our current work builds on both our strong history of prioritizing racial justice, as well as our historic relationships with CAUSA and PCUN.\r\n\r\nIn the past 4-5 years, our work has begun to incorporate more direct organizing among immigrants and people of color, especially Latinos, in rural Oregon   We have coordinated efforts with our friends at CAUSA and PCUN, and built a Latino organizing program that prioritizes leadership development of rural Latinos and integration of those leaders into ROP\u2019s infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nIn 2008 we hired a bilingual, bicultural staff person with experience organizing rural Latinos.  In 2011 we hired one of the leaders from our Latino Advisory Board. Our number of Latino-led human dignity groups has grown to 6 and ROP hosted our second annual Latino Leadership Retreat in March, 2012 with over 50 participants.  ROP has built a Latino Advisory Board (LAB), and that committee now has two members who cross-over with the Board of Directors.  LAB is playing a key role in our current Strategic Planning process.\r\n\r\nWe have welcomed this internal shift in our membership and leadership, and have dedicated real resources towards not only recruiting and developing leaders of color, but also towards the internal organizational work with our current majority white board, staff and membership.  Through our yearlong strategic planning process, which will conclude in 2013, we have taken time as an organization to delve into potential obstacles and make a plan for how to move to the next organizational phase as a multi-cultural organization.  First steps include incorporating racial justice language into our mission, vision, values statement, formalizing the leadership role of LAB in our organization, recruiting more Latino leaders for a stronger presence on our board, and a dismantling racism workshop that will take place on June 9th with our board, staff, and several dozen key ROP members.  We will continue to flesh out a plan that allows us to do our work engaging white people in racial justice (which has been held up as a national model, including in Chris Crass\u2019 new book \u201cTowards Collective Liberation: Anti-Racist Organizing, Feminist Praxis, and Movement Building Strategy\u201d), as we expand our base to include the growing rural Latino population.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "As of the economic crash beginning in 2008, we are in a new economic reality.  The wealth gap between the richest and the poorest has grown, with the wealthy growing wealthier and the poor and middle-class growing poorer in the past 5 years.  With no end in site for the recession, a growing number of people chained to insurmountable debt, the systematic dismantling of public programs and infrastructure, and the potential fallouts of climate change, our communities face new times and advanced challenges. We need strategies to build power and push back, and we desperately need to re-envision local economies.  \r\n\r\nWe are still in the early phases of this campaign.  In this phase of our work, we tap those places where the economic fallout is simply unbearable, developing shared, statewide push back strategies and creating local organizing campaigns. The small town economic justice movement we are building offers a creativity, boldness, and urgency to economic justice work more generally.  When a post office is slated for closure in a small Oregon town\u2026that is critical community infrastructure at risk.  When an immigrant family is facing foreclosure after the deportation of a bread earner\u2026we know that family and their value in the community.  When a project to transport coal through our community is planned\u2026we easily envision the impact on our few small-scale agricultural businesses due to coal dust.\r\n\r\nThe economic crisis is affecting rural communities in very tangible ways, ways that a neighbor-to-neighbor organizing approach is of value. Using our historic \u201cFight the Right\u201d frame we\u2019re able to draw connections between the attacks on the post office with attacks on queers and immigrants to the growing \u201cdebt\u201d class, building real solutions today while we build an intersectional, multi-issue view of how to fight corporate power and build the communities we need. \r\n",

Without grassroots intervention, this new green economy will continue to exclude and marginalize communities of color and low income families.\r\n\r\nGot Green\u2019s vision is that a new, green economy must provide increased health, economic opportunity, and a sustainable standard of living for all members of our society. Specifically: 1) living wage, green jobs; 2) healthy, affordable food; 3) energy-efficient and healthy housing; and 4) quality, public transportation. Currently we are working on two issues within this 4-point framework:\r\n\r\nUNEMPLOYMENT AND LACK OF ACCESS TO GOOD, LOCAL JOBS\r\nGot Green organizes in the Rainier Valley, where 77% of residents are people of color, and the unemployment rate is double that of Seattle as a whole. In 2011 we door knocked 700 Rainier Valley households and identified a hot issue: word on the streets was no one from the neighborhood was getting hired to rebuild the Rainier Beach Community Center. Further research identified a bigger issue: The City of Seattle has no policy to ensure that local jobs will be created by public infrastructure and construction projects. \r\n\r\nLOW INCOME FAMILIES CAN\u2019T AFFORD HEALTHY FOOD\r\nOf 212 women we surveyed in 2011, more than 2/3\u2019s said access to healthy food was their top priority; but they just couldn\u2019t afford it. Women told us they are forced to make impossible choices; pay the rent or buy healthy food. Their experience is backed up by statewide and national data. One in two U.S. children will be on food assistance at some point; and Washington State ranks #7 nationally for the highest increase in families going hungry 2008. In 2013 our Healthy Food Access Team is organizing to get a new City of Seattle program funded that will help 25,000 low income families stretch their dollars at local farmers\u2019 markets and put local produce on their table.\r\n\r\nGOT GREEN\u2019s FORMULA TO BUILD POWER: 1) Identify issues that emerge out of our constituents\u2019 experiences; 2) Build constituent-led grassroots committees to lead each of our campaigns; 3) Find coalition partners who add value to our work (ie. Legal experts; policy researchers; labor unions); 4) Lead strategic campaigns to change public policies; 5) Show strength in numbers; 6) Build lasting organization with deep and broad leadership and strong infrastructure.\r\n",

In direct response to the top priority identified through 210 face-to-face surveys, we formed and supported the women-led Food Access Team. The Team became a place for women of color and low income women to find their voice, influence public policy, and hone their leadership. Our Food Access Team has successfully inserted the perspective of low income women of color into the food justice, anti-hunger, and labor movements (through the grocery union\u2019s anti-Walmart campaign).\r\n\r\nFollowing the model of Women in Green, the Young Workers Project was launched in 2013, to survey 150 young people (ages 18-34) about their priorities for and barriers in accessing green jobs and training; and to center their leadership in shaping Got Green\u2019s future work.\r\n\r\nWith a grant and technical assistance from the Western States Center, we joined the 2012 NW Strong Families Cohort (Community to Community, Seattle Young People\u2019s Project, and Catalyst for Kids). The Cohort helped us deepen our analysis of oppression and join a national movement to challenge stigmas and systems that prevent families of all kinds \u2013 including LGBTQ, immigrant, low income, and single parent families - from striving. \r\n\r\nOur 2012 annual Got Green leadership retreat brought together 25 core leaders to discuss how our different struggles as people of color, women, seniors, workers, immigrants, youth, and LGBTQ folks are linked together, and how we can create a space for each of us to lead. We are committed to building a movement where community members can come as their full selves and be supported at Got Green and in the work that we do. ",

We believe that communities of color and low income/working class communities care deeply about the environment and climate change. However our communities need to be brought into the \u201cgreen movement\u201d and on our own terms. In each of our campaigns we work to match a community-driven issue or need with a solution that benefits both low income communities of color and our natural environment. \r\n\r\nOur Fresh Bucks Campaign is a good example. Low income women want to consume healthy, fresh food \u2013 but they can\u2019t afford it. The Fresh Bucks pilot provided matching dollars for families on EBT/Food stamps to shop at farmers\u2019 markets. Markets sell locally grown produce \u2013 cutting down on the trip from field to table. Therefore targeting City Council to make Fresh Bucks a permanent food access program meets low income communities\u2019 needs and supports Seattle\u2019s Climate Action Plan: a win-win campaign.\r\n",

In 2011, Got Green partnered with the Fight for a Fair Economy campaign to employ graduates of our weatherization job training on a door-to-door canvas in the Rainier Valley about the economy and its impacts on families. From 700 conversations with community members, Got Green identified the issue of construction jobs on the Rainier Beach Community Center and street paving along Rainier Ave S. We were appalled to learn that there is no requirement for contractors to hire locally. Got Green organized community members to form the South Jobs Committee of un/under-employed workers of color, intent on winning local jobs for residents hit hardest by the economic recession. \r\n \r\nBarriers, such as racial and gender discrimination, language, incarceration, and lack of opportunities for training, have kept our communities out of living wage jobs with career pathways. When Initiative 200 reversed affirmative action, hiring programs in Washington State and organizers for racial justice struggled even more with how to create job opportunities for workers of color and women workers. Local hire policies are a new tool to create racial equity in employment.  \r\n\r\nWhat is working? Cities like Oakland, Hartford, Portland, Berkley, and San Francisco have rolled out local hiring policies and they are making a difference. Under \u201ctargeted local hiring\u201d policies, marginalized workers can gain more access to career opportunities, valuable job skills, and earning power to revitalize their neighborhoods and local economy.   \r\n\r\nProjections suggest that up to 3,000 construction and related jobs will be created annually by publicly funded projects. With unemployment figures in the Rainier Valley running at double the rate in the rest of our city, a Targeted Local Hire Ordinance is long overdue. A Targeted Local Hire Ordinance will help ensure that the benefits coming to the community will actually benefit the community, instead of further displacing and impoverishing them. \r\n\r\nGot Green has built both the grassroots constituent-led committee and broad based coalition necessary to win a Targeted Local Hire Ordinance. Our March 23 Community Jobs Forum demonstrated the collective power we are building through the Local Hire Ordinance campaign. With this forward momentum, Got Green believes we can win a Targeted Local Hire Ordinance for our community in 2013.\r\n",

We are reaching out to other groups whose communities would also benefit from local, living wage jobs and and are supportive of environmental justice initiatives. Current partners include: Puget Sound Sage, Casa Latina, The Minority Electrical Workers Caucus, Sierra Club, and the Rainier Beach Community Empowerment Coalition. The partnership with Casa Latina has brought the valuable voices and representation of constituency of Latino workers that Got Green did not have the capacity to reach. The new partnership with Sierra Club is allowing Got Green to connect this local issue to a broader supportive audience.\r\n\r\nGot Green is a participant of the South CORE (Coalition Organizing for Regional Equity) convened by Puget Sound Sage as a collaboration between organizations doing work along MLK and the Sound Transit Light Rail line.

We are dedicated to give voice to the community demand for jobs and hold fast to our vision that the green economy must uplift our communities by providing equity and opportunity. \r\n \r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a license, a job, a career; my own place. I easily could have become a statistic. The system is set up against our communities and I fell victim to that system. I never thought I\u2019d be in this position - it\u2019s a blessing to be here.\u201d Got Green board-member Sintayehu Tekle went from being an unemployed immigrant to community activist with a budding professional career as an apprentice electrician. \r\n \r\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not on the front end of this new green movement, it will become just one more opportunity in society that leaves us behind.\u201d said Tammy Nguyen, founder and organizer of the Women and Green Economy Project.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "Oasis Youth Center was founded in 1985 as a grassroots community response to HIV and suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. For 28 years, Oasis has provided youth and young adults in Pierce County with a confidential drop-in, support and resource center for LGBTQ youth ages 14 to 24. Annually, 450 youth make about 4,800 visits to the center. Since 1997, Oasis has been a program of the Pierce County AIDS Foundation. With multi-year capacity building support from the Queer Youth Initiative (led by Pride Foundation), Oasis will be entering into a fiscal sponsorship agreement with PCAF starting June 1, 2013. In addition to PCAF, Oasis has worked closely with the Rainbow Center over the years. \r\n\r\nThe Rainbow Center was founded in 1997 and is a separate 501(c)(3). Its mission is to eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity by providing education, resources, information, and opportunities for empowerment to individuals and organizations within the South Puget Sound. Rainbow Center activities fall into three general categories: education, advocacy, and celebration. In addition to providing 24 drop-in hours per week, the Rainbow Center provides convening space to 10+ partner organizations, including the Gender Alliance of the South Sound, Mpowerment, Queer Collective, and more.  Each year, individuals make 5,200 visits to the Rainbow Center.\r\n\r\nFor many years, the community has dreamed of having Oasis and the Rainbow Center under the same roof. With capacity building assistance, leadership development, and increased collaboration, we are now ready to take the next step. Together, Oasis and the Rainbow Center have launched the Creating Community Campaign with the goal of strategically situating the two entities side by side in a visible, public location in downtown Tacoma. Our co-location is not the end goal, but the strategic beginning of new possibilities.",

    "narrative3": "Since its inception, Oasis has been a confidential program (at an undisclosed location), and since 1997, an off-site program of PCAF. With increased community ownership of the needs and issues impacting LGBTQ youth, Oasis is ready to move into a public location. In moving, we will model a healthy and safe coming out process. We also want to enhance our youth-adult partnership by providing older youth with an immediate connection to the Rainbow Center as they age out, and by offering participants meaningful opportunities for inter-generational connection. \r\nBoth Oasis and the Rainbow Center have outgrown their current facilities. Our new shared center (coined the O.R.C. for Oasis and Rainbow Center) will include a kitchen, computer lab, and resource library. There will be a community room for breakout conversations and public gatherings, as well as distinct space for each entity. By working together, we can further address the root causes of racism, sexism, and homophobia that continue to negatively impact our community. Through the O.R.C, we will build collect power and engage in community organizing through the following shared spaces: \r\n1) Oasis and Rainbow Center are key partners in Housing 4 Success (H4S), a new housing program for LGBTQ youth in Pierce County. Through H4S, staff from other partner organizations will be onsite at the ORC to provide housing and shelter intake services. H4S relies on a host home model and the Rainbow Center contributes to the program success by helping to recruit a diverse pool of housing hosts, while Oasis recruits homeless youth in need of stable, safe housing. \r\n2) Both Oasis and Rainbow Center are part of the Pierce County Crime Victim Service Center to provide prevention and victim of crime advocacy to LGBTQ individuals. As we move into the same space, we will work together to model a safe and healthy community, and will continue to offer relevant and innovative programming about healthy relationships, violence prevention, and advocacy for those who are dealing with the impact of violence in their lives.  \r\n3) Shared resources, including a library and technology center. Many visitors have no identification so they cannot get a public library card. And, many high school libraries simply do not offer a selection that is pertinent to the issues of Oasis youth. Many participants attend the centers from local shelters or their family home, and  are often in circumstances where it is unsafe to be open about their LGBTQ identity \u2013 so even checking out a book from a library to take  home is often not an option. By offering a single one-stop resource for engaging with the community, we will enhance our collective power, reduce isolation of youth and elders, and  increase opportunities for long-term change.",

Current combined attendance is over 1,000 visits per month. It is anticipated that visits will rise sharply with sufficient room for programming, improved transit access, and connectivity between the two entities. While approximately 75 percent of visitors to Oasis and the Rainbow Center live or work in Pierce County, both entities annually serve people from 15 counties. Combined, our programming calendars offer more than 25 days of programming per month. The new joint center will be in use from approximately 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday, from 10 a.m. to midnight on Saturday, and as needed on Sunday. This includes 48 hours of core drop-in time for Oasis (24 hours per week) and the Rainbow Center (24 hours per week). Outcomes-based evaluation will be facilitated through a Customer Relationship Management database recently purchased by Oasis through grant funding and shared with the Rainbow Center. It will allow interactions with current and future clients as well as provide information to evaluate programs and services. In addition, quarterly or semiannual focus groups with participants will generate thoughtful analysis of existing and new services which will allow tailoring all programming, services, and resources to match the diverse needs of those accessing Oasis and the Rainbow Center.", 
    "narrative5": "Oasis and the Rainbow Center arrived at the decision to co-locate out of our intensive collaboration. The purpose of co-location and our partnership is to be stronger together, and to offer more, than either entity could be on its own. An example of this is the kitchen in our new building. Neither entity has ever had a kitchen with a stove or dishwasher. Because of collaboration, we are able to fundraise together for one shared kitchen, rather than two smaller and less resourced kitchens. To the collaboration, Oasis offers lots of energy and an engaged group of youth who have tremendous hope for the future. The Rainbow Center offers a connection to10+ partner organizations that utilize Rainbow Center space. Oasis and the Rainbow Center would not be able to engage in this effort were it not for a deep commitment to collaboration, and the belief that together, we are stronger. \r\n\r\nExternally, both Oasis and the Rainbow Center participate in the Tacoma Pride Festival (TPF), with the Rainbow Center as the lead organization. TPF is a multi-day festival that was started in 2011 to raise awareness and celebrate the LGBTQ community. TPF producing partners include the Broadway Center, faith communities, Grand Cinema, PCAF, local businesses, and more. The impact of TPF is that community partners are engaged throughout the year, coming together in the summer to reach thousands of participants in multi-day, LGBTQ affirming programming. \r\n\r\nWe also partner with PCAF and Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department int the HIV Coalition. The Coalition's goal is to share resources, increase dialogue, and grow trust. The result has been tremendous. PCAF offers Mpowerment programming onsite at Oasis and the Rainbow Center. Because of our collaboration, we are able to increase HIV testing opportunities and affirm the health and well-being of the LGBTQ community. ", 
    "narrative6": "In the LGBTQ,  community homophobia routinely intersects with multiple other forms of oppression, and both the Rainbow Center and Oasis Youth Center have long been committed to combating this homophobia, especially as it pertains to communities of\r\ncolor. Oasis Youth Center recognizes that nearly half of the youth who attend drop-in hours come from racially diverse backgrounds--often these youth struggle with issues of acceptance, even from within their own community. Oasis Youth Center consistently provides programming such as Open Mic and Oasis Youth Council, both of which affirm all aspects of a youth's identity as they to develop a positive voice within their community.\r\n\r\nOf all who come to the Rainbow Center (RC) on a weekly basis 85-90% indentify as LGBTQ, 70-80% are economically disadvantaged and 40% are multiracial or other peoples of color. The Rainbow Center provides computers for fee for anyone that comes in to look for work, housing or other services on their own. In addition both entities provide resources to help with\r\njob searchs, housing resources and assistance for victims of crime. The RC also allows connection to its Wi-Fi for those that come with their own computer needing to do research and or services and assistance. The Rainbow Center offers an All Ages Karaoke also provides free snacks and drinks to all who attend and has become a great event for bringing together and strengthening the\r\nbonds of diverse racial, cultural and LGBTQ identified peoples.\r\n\r\nThe Rainbow Center also provides space for other diverse groups to meet for a nominal fee, allowing members of the group to attend for free. The Queer Collective is a group that meets monthly to build and strengthen community in Tacoma. The group is free and welcoming to anyone to attend and discuss and community needs that have been identified and require additional resources and guidance to address and work to solve. Regularly attending and leading the monthly meetings are a diverse group of leaders from Tacoma city and state governments, to other social justice groups and non-profits. This diverse group is often able to direct those looking to address community needs to the right people and organizations. Another group that meets at Oasis and the Rainbow Center is Mpowerment, an HIV prevention program by and for men who have sex with men. In Washington State, men of color are disproportionately impacted by HIV. PCAF, Oasis, and the Rainbow Center are working together to address these challenges as part of our ongoing social justice work.\r\n\r\nOasis and the Rainbow Center reflect Pierce County as a whole. Pierce County is more racially diverse, lower income, and has higher rates of HIV infection than nearly any other county in the state.  ",

On October 10, 2011, World Homeless Action Day, Right 2 Dream Too invited people experiencing homelessness, to set up tents on an empty lot in Oldtown/Chinatown.  The organization was born of a process initiated by Right 2 Survive, in which a $1/year lease was negotiated with the owners of the plot of land.  Immediately, the tented community was perceived as threat by the Portland Business Alliance, who began pushing for fines to bankrupt the organization. The City of Portland didn\u2019t waste time branding the community as a \u201crecreational campground without permits\u201d, and issued fines also for the fence which protects Dreamers from the elements and from drunken people passing by.  To date, Right 2 Dream Too, whose majority is comprised of houseless individuals, and low income allies, has been fined over 20,000 dollars.  \r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy search for legal representation, Right 2 Dream Too filed suit against the city on International Human Rights Day, December 10th, 2012.  R2DToo continues to seek redress through the legal process, all the while, building a political campaign to change the policies that punish people for survival activities.\r\n\r\nOur greatest accomplishment is increasing the participation and leadership of houseless people speaking out against the criminalization of houseless people, demonstrating for human rights, and living the example of an alternative every day.  Right 2 Dream Too has become a model for other houseless organizers in Santa Cruz, CA, Eugene and Ashland, OR, and Salt Lake City, Utah. ",

At R2DToo, we can get the sleep we need to function without fear of being harassed.  We can prepare food, access restrooms and clean clothing, as well as learn about our rights and become empowered to change the unjust laws and policies that keep us trapped in a web of poverty.  We organize and participate in actions that bring to light the oppressive practices used to target our country\u2019s most vulnerable citizens, including what\u2019s happening to R2DToo  itself.  \r\n\r\nThe R2DToo Rest Area is an emergency/transitional model of shelter.  The city is using a code violation, \u201cestablishing a recreational campground without permits\u201d in an attempt to bankrupt the organization.  Code violations are being enforced around the country as a tactic for shutting down services that benefit people without housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing code violations to remove unhoused people from the public view, parallels another tactic being used around the country, with roots right here in Portland.  In 2010,  our neoliberal City Council passed a \u201csidewalk management plan\u201d.  This policy came on the heels of two consecutive sit/lie ordinances, which targeted the houseless population, and were both declared unconstitutional.  The City Council used the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to justify passage of a plan targeting a community with high numbers of disabled people.  Those in power use these undemocratic tools covertly to enforce a policy of removal which has targeted poor and disabled people in Oregon since 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR2DToo members, called Dreamers, are going to schools, conferences, rallies, and other events, to educate housed community members about laws and policies that are often invisible to them, because of their selective enforcement.  \r\n\r\nLeadership by people experiencing houselessness is  only possible when you have a supportive community in place where people can meet their basic needs.  We\u2019re committed to keeping R2DToo thriving and viable, because we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of people organizing and participating in monthly actions at City Hall, educating others about the Homeless Bill of Rights, and working on committees in our sister organization, Right 2 Survive.  For example, this year, the committee organizing Pitch-A-Tent, a public camp out to educate people about the criminalization of those without housing, is bigger than ever!  Half of the twenty organizers involved in this project reside at R2DToo.  The sense of value and purpose that our organizers develop, is both an asset for them as they move from the streets into housing, and finding employment, and as leaders in a social justice movement that values the voices of those most directly impacted.",

    "narrative4": "Right 2 Dream Too is working to build power this year, through leadership development, fostering relationships, consistent outreach and education, development of a toolkit so others can learn from us and create campaigns in their communities, and creating a self-sustaining fundraising infrastructure.  We are part of a National movement to overturn oppressive policies that criminalize poor people, and reposition ourselves as leaders in co-creating solutions.  Our goals and objectives are measurable.  The very existence of our unique model of self managed shelter with a focus on community empowerment is dependent on effective community organizing.  Our work plan is multi-faceted and based on lessons we have learned, as well as examining other similar struggles in Portland and across the country.  \r\n\r\nThis summer we will develop a toolkit with our members so that people in other communities can replicate our (and other\u2019s) models.  We will work with Right 2 Survive, SLEEPS, Dignity, SHARE, and other tented communities to produce this kit.\r\n\r\nWe will be focusing on creating a center for organizer training at Right 2 Dream Too, where members of the houseless and housed community can share information and support each other's campaigns.  This is an important development for our community, because it removes barriers that are still present for our houseless organizers, by bringing the technology and expertise to them, rather than asking them to come to trainings, and use technology at other locations.  We will increase our organizing and fundraising capacity tremendously, and give allies an opportunity to form closer relationships with our community members.\r\n\r\nOur goals are clear and measurable. We will secure a legal place for R2DToo, \u201cbuild\u201d the education and empowerment center, pass the Homeless Bill of Rights, set up an internal fundraising structure, and have a downloadable toolkit developed by our community.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Right 2 Dream Too collaborates with a number of organizations including Bmedia, Sisters of the Road, Dignity Village, City Repair, and SHARE.  Right 2 Survive, is our closest partner organization, offering support to R2Dtoo and depending on us for new leaders.  \r\nWhile most of our collaborations are local and regional, we also are standing for International Human Rights.  One example is our relationship with the ASOTRECOL Solidarity Network.  ASOTRECOL is the association of injured workers from the General Motors Plant in Bogota, Colombia.  Right 2 Dream Too invited members of the local solidarity group to talk with us and speak at rallies in front of R2Dtoo.  Dreamers help educate others by participating in rallies and videos about the injured workers and their struggle for justice.  Right 2 Dream Too distributed hundreds of solidarity bracelets made in the tents in Colombia, as part of an education campaign.  We are also learning about strategy and tactics from them.  By including us in their videos, ASOTRECOL Solidarity has also elevated our visibility.  It is a mutually beneficial relationship.  We have many disabled workers at R2Dtoo and we are connected in the struggle for universal human rights.\r\n\r\nR2Dtoo collaborates with other organizations led by unhoused people and their allies.  Last year we were asked by SLEEPS (Safe Legally Entitled Emergency Places to Sleep), based in Eugene, OR, to bring a delegation of Dreamers to talk with houseless organizers, the faith based community, and housed community members.  R2Dtoo members testifid in front of City Council, and met with officials.  This collaboration has continued, and just recently the Eugene City Council recognized the need for legal places to sleep, with a proposal echoing elements of our rest area model.  This collaboration is a two way support and learning relationship that is having an impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Right 2 Dream Too works for racial justice and fighting the multiple oppressions that intersect with racism.  We build relationships with other organizations led by communities of color, and support campaigns against racial profiling. We are setting up our Education and Empowerment Center at Right to Dream Too where we will be training our community about fighting oppressions including racism, heterosexism, transphobia, ableism, and classism.  We have joined in solidarity with the Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO) and the Urban League on their anti-racial profiling campaign. We work with Occupy Northeast \u201cThe Black Working Group\u201d on their housing justice work. One of our transgender organizers is reaching out to the Sexual and Gender Minorities Youth Resource Center (SMYRC) to activate, learn from and organize it\u2019s members. R2Dtoo a strict code of conduct where hate language is unacceptable.  We co-create an inclusive environment for people in need of a safe place to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe City of Portland has created \u201cDrug Free Zones\u201d in it\u2019s downtown core, including Old Town where Right to Dream Too is located. When they did this some years back the program was discontinued due to the broad community perception that it was an excuse to racially profile African Americans. We are working in solidarity with the CIO and the Urban league to call for an end to racial profiling in Portland. These policies exclude people (disproportionately African American people) from areas of the city that are the core of employment and transit opportunities. Once excluded these individuals have a constant fear of being incarcerated for just trying to make their way through our city. This heightened level of security in Old Town creates more harassment and targeting of unhoused people who are staying in these areas. Right to Dream Too bears witness and weighs in on public comments about this exclusionary process, which impacts our community.\r\n\r\nRight to Dream Too is a leader at co-creating housing alternatives and has worked with the Black Working Group to do home defense against foreclosure. The predatory lending practices that have led to the current foreclosure crisis were intentionally focused on communities of color, and we stand in solidarity with the defense against these foreclosures.\r\n\r\nThrough our Education and Empowerment Center we will be educating each other about our diverse cultural, racial, gender and sexual identities in a safe environment.  We will invite presenters from organizations led by those directly affected, including African American home owners fighting foreclosure eviction, day laborers from VOZ Workers\u2019 Rights Education Project, homeless youth from the Sexual Minorities Youth Resource Center.  We look forward to deepening relationships, building more solidarity, and gaining more profound understanding about multiple oppressions.",

We work together to create the conditions for people to freely seek employment, education, and personal development.  We provide opportunities to engage in transforming the institutions and policies that perpetuate inequity.  \r\n\r\nR2Dtoo is part of a national movement where economic refugees of our failed capitalist policies are standing together to take their place in recreating communities based on people and not profit.  At our rest area, members and overnighters get relief from the burdens of homelessness such as having no place to store one\u2019s belongings, and interrupted rest because of harassment by local security and police.  With this relief, members are finding employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as accessing supportive services like healthcare and social security checks.  \r\n\r\nOur focus on supporting people to become community organizers is another way that we hope to achieve both personal and systemic transformation.  With the experience members of R2Dtoo gain, we are effectively engaging in job retraining for social justice.  Working with people to develop their talents and follow their passions, we plan to provide stipends for the much needed work we do.  In turn, this experience and the results will open new doors for our organizers.\r\n\r\nOur work on the Homeless Bill of Rights campaign, will lead to the codification of non-discrimination for our houseless community in Oregon.  It will give us another legal path to replicate creative co-housing communities like R2Dtoo and demand other just solutions instead of criminalization. From this platform we will build more power to join and win campaigns for just wages, redistribution of wealth through participatory budgeting, green job programs, and myriad other inclusive strategies to transform communities into thriving centers where all people\u2019s needs are supported through collective action.",

    "narrative3": "Identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer, or questioning one\u2019s gender or sexual orientation is not a mental health disorder. But due to our heteronormative society, many LGBTQ youth have experienced parental rejection, homelessness, harassment, discrimination and trauma which often leads to vulnerability to mental health issues, substance abuse and self-harm. Eighty percent of LGBT students in Washington have experienced verbal harassment because of their sexual orientation; 30% have been physically harassed because of how they expressed their gender. In Washington, suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth ages 15-19. Youth identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers. LGBTQ youth are often marginalized and stigmatized by the broader community, and have limited support compared with their heterosexual and cisgendered peers. LGBTQ youth with various intersections of identities, including cultural, religious and racial, may feel particularly alone. (GLSEN, 2009; Washington State Department of Health, 2003; Massachusetts Department of Education, 2009)\r\n\r\nWe believe that all people have a right to fully develop their capacities and express themselves regardless of their origins, race, age, nationality, gender expression, or \u201cdifferences.\u201d Affirming an individual\u2019s value is key to empowering them to be proactive. POW is a community that accepts, supports and advocates for all youth regardless of sexual orientation and gender expression. POW also challenges the youth to be personally active in issues that are important to them and the community.\r\n\r\nSocial justice advocacy and leadership skills development are part of the purpose of POW. POW participants have a strong desire to make an impact. The POW curriculum states, \u201cPOW identifies leadership as guiding the movement for LGBTQ awareness and equality through social action and community. POW members are leaders by having an honest understanding of who they are and inspiring others to support and empower LGBTQ youth in South King County.\u201d The 26-week curriculum includes units on Identity, Fighting Oppression, Holistic Health, and Social Justice and Advancing the Cause.\r\n\r\nPOW seeks to reduce risk factors for depression, anxiety and suicide attempts by providing early intervention and support for LGBTQ youth; promotes wellness and reduces healthcare disparities by providing accurate and inclusive health and wellness education; and empowers youth and educates our community by facilitating youth-led advocacy activities. Youth state weekly, \u201cI wish POW was everyday\u201d or \u201cPOW is my high of the week.\u201d One member has reported suicidal ideation and identifies POW as his reason for being alive. Two POW members became homeless and were taken in by other POW members. One member disclosed being raped in the past by her father.

Strategies include weekly meetings, and quarterly youth-led social change projects and community events.\r\n\r\nIn January 2013, POW members completed a mural for a Burien bus shelter. In March 2013, POW hosted a Sex and Health Event with queer-positive sex and health resources from 13 agencies; 89 youth attended. On May 17th, POW will host a prom, supported by National Prevention Week, at Burien Community Center. The theme for this LGBTQ-and-allied-positive event will be Vampires vs. Zombies. POW will march in Seattle\u2019s Pride Parade in June, and will co-host a Queer Youth Party after the parade. POW\u2019s participation in PrideFest last year brought in several new members and volunteers. POW will host a Summer Celebration in August and a Winter Social in December, with other LGBTQ youth groups invited. Events allow LGBTQ and allied youth to celebrate their true selves, develop friendships and community, and increase safety and acceptance of LGBTQ people in South King County. In May 2013, POW co-facilitator Jennifer Gess will be leaving Navos to pursue her Ph.D. Co-facilitator Aaron Walsh will continue to run POW, and a therapist will be hired to replace Jennifer as POW manager and to counsel LGBTQ youth and families.\r\n\r\nPOW is evaluated based on the number of LGBTQ youth and allies participating, impact on members, the number and breadth of collaborating organizations, response from the community, and requests from schools and agencies for assistance with LGBTQ competency.",

Without a central point person, it is difficult to know who represents the Community. This leads to frustration and confusion with some of the other stakeholders about who really is the representative of FAST\u201d. We are a coalition with no presidents or secretaries or hierarchy. All workers, community agents, union leaders and progressive organizers are equal parts in this democratic coalition as long as they participate and want to implement/advance the social justice goals for our community. Our decisions are taken by consensus and any of our members could represent us with Sound transit and mega contractors.  We took Sound Transit\u2019s reason as a badge of honor. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "    Our country\u2019s growth was at the expense of the continent\u2019s indigenous peoples who suffered genocide, dislocation, and unspeakable patterns of violence on physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual levels. The adverse effects of this history carried down from generation to generation are known as historical trauma. Within these dysfunctional levels of trauma, the indigenous kinship roles have been altered along with manifesting historical trauma and displacing the two-spirits from their own communities. \r\n    Wisdom of the Elders has created a unique multimedia project in response to the discovery of historical trauma. The videos and teachings form a culturally tailored curriculum that fits the unique learning style of Native Americans. Sharing stories is a traditional native practice that provides a vehicle for learning and healing. We know that life is a difficult journey, one that causes some people to become lost along the way. In the video recordings and health and wellness teachings, tribal elders and storytellers reveal how they experienced being \u201clost,\u201d and they share how they found their way to eventually return to a meaningful life. \r\n     These teachings integrate positive identity development with building healthy relationships, encouraging appropriate conduct and skills development, and the restoring of traditional cultural values back into our family relationships. It provides hope for those affected by historical trauma, not just Native people, but all peoples, including two-spirits. Native people manifest stories of internalized ancestral trauma in the personal stories of their life. They demonstrate how trauma continues today to be unintentionally passed down to generations of Native American elders, adults, children and two-spirits who continue to suffer from multiple issues. Although this will continue to be felt for years to come, many Native leaders serve as role models to our people who are beginning to overcome the high rates of addictions, domestic violence, sexual abuse and homophobia. \r\n       Research indicates that historical pain becomes even more painful when it seems to be forgotten, trivialized, or denied. As we strive to end violence against all people, we have focused the vulnerable: Native women, children, and elders. We are now expanding our initiatives to develop a capacity and community support for the LGBTQ2S communities. Which include composing a Two-Spirit Allies Coalition to gather all the Native American serving organizations who advocate for the Native LGBTQ2S community members.  \r\n       The Discovering Our Story video productions and lessons being provided at WISDOM\u2019s website over the next three years are being created to help them, their extended families, and others as they re-awaken their identity, remember their own story and create their own career pathway plan. Our new initiatives are to emphasize the stories of the LGBTQ2S\u2019 and create curriculum's to be utilized within the school systems and to educate at multi-generational levels. \r\n",

We currently have produced our fourth series of American Indian public radio programs.  We have shared rare cultural arts content along with sustainability responses of tribal communities that are in the midst of unprecedented environmental degradation and climate change. This holistic cultural and science series has featured the voices of traditional Native American elders, storytellers, musicians, educators and traditional scientists from eight tribal communities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. \r\n             The proposed Two-Spirit series will include several segments each featuring homophobia, social injustice, gender and age discrimination from a LGBTQ2S stand point and community preparedness efforts relevant to strengthening our Two-Spirit allies within our communities. We will also introduce an artistic content, along with the wisdom and observations of tribal elders and  role models with traditional stories, music and dance, and cultural values.\r\n\r\n    Our assessments will be delivered through a community participatory effort.

    "narrative1": "Before 1996 repressive tactics by immigration officials and local police discouraged day laborers from seeking work on the corners of 3 major intersections in Portland, OR. Day laborers thus began to organize, and found they shared common incidences of exploitation, wage theft, and homelessness. In 1998 the Day Laborer Project, a project of the Workers\u2019 Organizing Committee, formed. Through strategic grassroots organizing and advocacy efforts, the Day Laborer Project successfully ended all I.C.E. raids on these intersections in the Central Eastside Industrial District and successfully began reclaiming stolen wages. As the Day Laborer Project built momentum and continued to empower other day laborers, the project separated from the Workers\u2019 Organizing Committee and in 2000 grew into Voz Workers\u2019 Rights Education Project (Voz).\r\n\r\nA plan finally emerged approved by the City of Portland in 2006 that included the establishment of a worker center, and Voz led the advocacy efforts for this unprecedented safe space. The Martin Luther King Jr. Worker Center finally opened in 2008. Voz was chosen by then City of Portland Mayor Tom Potter to operate the center and has been doing so every since. The MLK Jr. Worker Center offers a safe space for workers to find work, build community, increase their employability, and grow as community leaders. The center also provides opportunities for day laborers to build collective power, organize for their rights and have their voices heard through direct advocacy to policy-decision-makers.\r\n\r\nVoz Workers\u2019 Rights Education Project is a worker-led organization that empowers immigrants and day laborers to gain control over their working conditions through leadership development, grassroots organizing, and community education.\r\n\r\nSome Major Accomplishments:\r\n1.\tReclaimed more than $350,000 in wages since 2000.\r\n2.\tGenerated over 16,000 jobs since 2008.\r\n3.\tAdded reserves line item in organizational budget (board approved) for first time in organizational history in 2012.",

    "narrative3": "Day laborers are among the most economically vulnerable of the immigrant community because of irregular and hazardous work available to them and because of the high percentages of wage theft cases among them. On the street, day laborers face exploitation, homelessness, and wage theft. On the street they are also often targets for violent crimes such as armed robbery and hate-motivated assaults. Many day laborers migrate here to escape political persecution and/or economic injustice caused by globalization and US foreign and trade policies. Frustration with the high unemployment rate in Oregon is often directed at immigrants, particularly those who fit a stereotype of \u201cillegal\u201d. \r\n\r\nOur work is tied to national and global struggles for human rights and a just society. Immigration is a truly global issue. As our partners at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) suggest, we see the day laborers not as a problem but as a cultural phenomenon that reflects the complexity of our identities and the oppressions that we seek to overcome. National organizations rely on Voz to bring workers\u2019 voices to the table and to empower workers to effect change in the wider community.\r\n\r\nVoz is dedicated to achieving justice for low-wage immigrant workers, and because of this we must challenge racism, classism, and nativism as a crucial element of our work. We encourage day labor organizers to think critically about how their local efforts connect to broader struggles so that they are strengthened by the power and solidarity of the global movement. This knowledge emboldens our leaders, giving them confidence to believe in their ability to affect true social change. We seek to empower workers to defend themselves by uniting and working together. Day laborers become less vulnerable to abuse when they know their rights and when they educate and support each other through actions such as adhering to a community minimum wage. We then instill policies that support their efforts like requiring employers to pay a minimum wage ($12) at the MLK Jr. Worker Center. \r\n\r\nWe know direct-action advocacy efforts change institutional structures that cause the realities faced by day laborers. Thus day laborers attend conversations we have with city, county, and state policy-makers. Voz is a crucial community convener in the movement for day laborer rights community. Organizing activities are primarily located at the MLK Worker Center. Critical to the ongoing movement toward social justice, Voz provides disenfranchised day laborers with the opportunities and support to become leaders, to organize for their rights and to lend their voices to state and national policy decisions. Leaders from the day laborer community unify and strengthen their community through work with Voz in order to transform their own reality and hold their allies accountable.\r\n",

    "narrative5": "Voz is a founding group of the Safe Communities Project founded in 2010, charged with ending Police/ICE Collaborations in Multnomah County. This project became the Activists Coming Together for Justice and Dignity Network, or, A.C.T. Network in 2011. Voz has supported the network\u2019s efforts of ensuring those directly affected by Police/I.C.E. Collaborations are at the table with decision makers. We have also seen the network grow over the years to include the faith community, legal groups, and other social justice organizations. The A.C.T Network strategically planned and coordinated press conferences and rallies within each of our constituencies that proved successful in winning a small victory this year in county policies regarding I.C.E. holds. We move forward stronger than ever as a leader in this coalition to end all collaboration with ICE. \r\n\r\nWe also work closely with city officials, commissioners, and other elected officials to ensure the MLK Jr. Worker Center continues to increase the area\u2019s equity and livability. We actively encourage community members to write letters of support demonstrating their support for a permanent home for the MLK Jr. Worker Center. \r\n\r\nVoz is a leader in the coalition to Stop Wage Theft Now! in Oregon. We have consistently brought day laborer voices to the capital to change policies around wage theft. The progress the coalition has made towards educating legislators about the realities workers face regarding wage theft would not have happened without Voz\u2019s connection with the day laborer community. The coalition includes other social justice organizations, churches, foundations, and legislative allies.

When we are educating allies and the broader Portland community about day labor struggles, we integrate our analysis about how inequality and oppression play out in the immigration debate. The international labor movement  especially compliments racial justice movements because all immigrants come from varying cultures, geographic regions, economies, education levels, and health circumstances that are directly correlated with race. \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of day laborers are men, and while we work to protect immigrant rights, we also dismantle sexism in our work and among those we organize. We work with the Latino Sexual Health Coalition who has provided our staff with trainings that confront hetero-normative stereotypes, and various stigmas relating to gender and sexuality. A statement of equity and safety is prominently reiterated by board members in the center and trainings curriculum include a mandatory workshop specifically devoted to gender justice. The popular education techniques used to run all meetings, workshops and assemblies enable inclusion from all who are present so that we can continue to combine our racial justice work with our economic justice work. Facilitators ensure that the ground rules for meetings and workshops foster respect for differences and the inclusion of underrepresented communities.\r\n\r\nWhen immigration rights movements only address issues of visibility (on street corners), mainstream partnerships, health and safety concerns, they ignore critical social, political, cultural and economic disparities that erode the human rights of workers everywhere.

Day laborers build power within their own families and communities through Popular Education Methodology and organizing from street corners to the center. Not only do we involve day labors in advocacy efforts but we hold ourselves accountable to our mission of being worker-led by training and retaining a Board of directors predominately filled with current day laborers. Our strategies for moving economic justice forward impact the movement at two main levels:\r\n\r\n1. Culturally relevant organizing that combat internalized isms that paralyze and prevent workers from improving their positions within society. We organize workers on the street, one-on-one, and in the center. We also facilitate daily English as a Second Language classes and monthly vocational skills trainings. These trainings empower workers to gain control over their working conditions and increase their employability. Workers increase their revenue and stabilize their finances. \r\n2. Direct action advocacy and civic engagement efforts to combat institutions & structures that prevent day laborers from improving their positions. We bring day laborers directly to decision makers, train workers on how to lobby and how bills become laws, and politicize day laborers through Popular Education methodology Leadership trainings. Day laborers always have a strong visible presence at our annual May Day and MLK Jr. Day rallies and take ownership of letter writing drives and other activities for current campaigns. \r\n",

    "narrative1": "Stonewall Youth envisions a community in which all LGBTQQIA youth have a full spectrum of choices regarding their bodies, self-expression, relationships, and legal rights. Stonewall Youth is an organization built and sustained by our community for 22 years. We began in 1991 as a series of community meetings of youth and adults to discuss the needs of LGBTQQIA young people in Thurston County. Since then, our capacity and services have evolved with the support and guidance of committed staff, youth leaders, mentors and funders, like the Social Justice Fund. Stonewall Youth holds both direct service support work and social justice organizing at the core of our organization.\r\n\r\n Some of our accomplishments include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Surviving as the oldest queer youth organization in our area, celebrating two decades of existence and uninterrupted weekly support group services for 22 years;\r\n\r\n\u2022 Providing the only resource for many LGBTQQIA youth who live in rural southwest Washington, and providing services to a breadth of LGBTQQIA youth, and the organizations and institutions that serve them, in many counties, with a limited budget/staff; and\r\n\r\n\u2022 Maintaining consistently free, relevant and youth led programs for LGBTQQIA youth.\r\n\r\n\u2022 In 2010 we realized a long-term dream of moving to a larger more accessible space co-located with allied organizations, allowing us to pool resources and better serve our community.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Throughout the past year we have been working towards our organizational goals of increasing the diversity of our leadership, continuing to educate ourselves about adultism, and working to better serve LGBTQQIA youth of color, LGBTQQIA youth with disabilities, and LGBTQQIA youth who experience homelessness. We have expanded our Board of Directors, now 50% youth, to include members with more diverse backgrounds, instituted a Youth Council leadership arm, and worked with partner organiations to better serve target populations.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Our work addresses the isolation and trauma that LGBTQQIA youth face in Thurston County and surrounding rural areas. Today, LGBTQQIA youth are significantly more likely than their peers to experience violence, attempt suicide, and abuse substances. In schools, they experience hate crimes, bullying, and are unable to access basic services such as culturally competent teachers, relevant curriculum, and safe bathrooms. These injustices lead to depression, high drop out rates, and serious health issues. Factors such as family rejection contribute to the statistic that over 40% of homeless youth are LGBTQQIA identified. LGBTQQIA youth face barriers to accessing social services such as health care, safe housing, foster care, and experience higher rates of violence in the juvenile justice system. The institutional oppression and micro-aggressions faced by young people who are gender variant, trans, and non-heteronormative causes trauma, isolation, and violence in our communities. Stonewall Youth supports LGBTQQIA individuals and brings communities together in Thurston county and surrounding areas to address these issues and create change.\r\n\r\nAt Stonewall Youth, we build collective power through leadership, structure, programs, community outreach, and collaborations. The organization is comprised of a three-person staff collective, Board of Directors, Youth Council, Speakers\u2019 Bureau, participants and volunteers. Decisions are made through processes involving all aforementioned parties, each of which include youth members. We prioritize sustainability and the success of youth in leadership positions. In 2012, Youth Council formed with the goal of structurally amplifying youth voices. Youth Council currently has two stipend Board Member positions and 7 core members. Last month we held a three-day long retreat with 30 members (two-thirds of which were youth) and did strategic planning to identify and address the root causes of power dynamics, redistribute power, and amplify the voices of youth, people of color, people with disabilities, and marginalized identities within the organization. We believe healing, education, and fun are essential for sustaining collective power. We design support, arts, music, and education programs to promote growth, awareness, and build allyship skills in ourselves and communities. We strive to align ourselves with campaigns and movements and support the work of social justice organizations because we know we are stronger together.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, one active Stonewall Youth participant (age 17) told me they contacted us because they felt alone, and now, in less than one year with Stonewall Youth, are an activist in their community.  As youth age out of our programs, some integrate into ally roles in the organization, some stay in rural areas, and many move to cities.  We support the leadership of youth who create change in their lives, schools, and institutions. We believe the resilience, skills, and collective power we build together manifests in strong and engaged communities members. \r\n",

Our strategies focus on sustainability and collective power. We will continue regular Queer and Trans People of Color community meetings. We will amplify youth voices within our organization through Youth Council, supporting their work with resources, trainings, and collective visioning at our annual Retreat. We will sustain Speakers\u2019 Bureau, a group of 10 youth, with one staff coordinator, that facilitate anti-oppression workshops to schools, organizations, and service providers.\r\n\r\nWe will continue weekly Drop In Hours and Peer Support Groups for LGBTQQIA youth, and are collaborating with the Lakes Highschool GSA in starting a Support Group on the Fort Lewis Military Base for LGBTQQIA youth of military families. We are doing outreach in surrounding counties with the hopes of fostering support networks for LGBTQ youth in rural communities. \r\n\r\nWe are collaborating with several organizations in Thurston County to vision and implement harm reduction strategies for reducing homelessness in LGBTQQIA populations. On June 27th we will host a panel with local youth, organizers, government officials, and activists to address the issues that LGBTQQIA youth who are homeless face, and how we can work together towards a healthy and housed community.\r\n\r\nWith our focus on long term goals of building powerful, thriving, and diverse LGBTQQIA communities we may not ever be able to fully measure outcomes. We will assess programs, staff, and volunteers through informal and formal evaluations, focus groups, and surveys.

    "narrative5": "As an organization in a more rural area, collaborations are essential to our work. Stonewall Youth collaborates with several organizations in Thurston County to work towards ending homelessness in LGBTQQIA populations. We have worked for many years withPartners In Prevention Education (PiPE), an organization whose mission is to engage homeless and at-risk youth and adult allies in the elimination of sexual assault and domestic violence as it contributes to homelessness and as it exists in street culture. Together we host an art therapy program for LGBTQQIA youth, Queer Art Heals Your Heart, and this year opened Saturday Drop In Hours for LGBTQQIA youth who experience homelessness. We have applied for funding for further collaborations with PIPE including mural projects, continued Drop In Programs, and a homeless youth Speakers' Bureau/zine project. We have been collaborating with the Peoples House, an alliance of activists, organizers, social service providers, and interfaith groups working with individuals who experience homelessness and the City of Olympia to open a 24 hour drop in center. Stonewall Youth has participated in envisioning a center that is inclusive to LGBTQQIA youth, adults, and families. We have organized trainings and consultations with Community Youth Services, an organization that empowers youth at-risk and their families to meet their goals for safety, stability, belonging and success by providing a continuum of individualized services and advocacy. These folks in addition to LGBTQQIA youth that experience homelessness are participating in our June 27th community panel. Through these collaborations we build a movement to address homelessness that is inclusive and specific to LGBTQQIA populations. \r\n\r\nWe collaborate with Pizza Klatch, an organization that runs LGBTQQIA Peer Support Groups in nine high schools in Olympia, Tumwater, and Lacey. Stonewall Youth fiscally sponsors Pizza Klatch and our Staff facilitate Pizza Klatch Groups, train volunteers, and support administrative work. ", 
    "narrative6": "At Stonewall Youth we are prioritizing racial diversity in our staff, Board, and volunteers in order in order to better reflect the needs of our whole community, better meet the needs of people of color (POC), and provide avenues of leadership for POC youth. Thurston County is a mostly white rural economy with minority race populations facing great marginalization and loss of visibility. We are working to meet the specific needs of LGBTQQIA youth of color, who lack access to services that treat the intersections of all their identities, as most local services are provided in settings lacking a critical race lens or are lacking in persons of color in positions of leadership. In an effort to address this intersection, we have recently organized a community meeting space for queer trans persons of color. In line with our organizational priorities to increase leadership amongst POC populations, this group was created and staffed by a intern who is a person of color. Typically we limit our programs to youth under 21 but in recognition of the greater community need, combined with the overwhelming lack of local resources for communities of color, we have kept this group open to community members of all ages. Funding struggles limit our ability to strengthen this group and with funding from SJF we can sustain and stabilize this crucial community resource.\r\n\r\nWe strive to balance the responsibilities of an organization populated by both white youth and youth of color.  We challenge the tokenizing of POC youth and staff as we work to increase their visibility, access to power, and self determination by constantly educating ourselves.  In April we received a training on systemic intersections of oppression for 30 youth, staff, and Board members, from the Anti Oppression Training and Resource Alliance (AORTA).   In the past year staff members have attended trainings from the Coalition of Anti-Racist Whites, the Seattle Race Conference, and participated in various communities organizing for racial justice.  This year we sent three participants to the FIERCE (Fabulous Independent Educated Radicals for Community Empowerment) conference for LGBTQQIA youth of color in Chicago.  At Stonewall Activism Summer School and Speakers' Bureau trainings we have hosted workshops from organizers of the Evergreen State College Queer People of Color student group, and local activists and trainers organizing for racial justice.  Speakers' Bureau facilitates community workshops addressing the intersections of racism, classism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and adultism. They provide trainings on how to be an ally to target identity groups, and how to address and interrupt oppression. We will continue to educate ourselves and our community, to participate in a collaborative and holistic movement towards racial justice, and to support leadership of POC at Stonewall Youth. \r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The epidemic of homelessness in the US continues year after year, and Oregon\u2019s homelessness remains above the national average. Safe and affordable housing is inaccessible to thousands of people thanks to federal divestment in public housing. So-called \u201cquality of life\u201d laws in Portland and elsewhere in the state negatively affect our community by criminalizing such acts as camping for survival. These laws echo past discriminatory laws from Oregon\u2019s history like redlining, ugly laws and sundown laws. Most recently, the Portland Business Alliance (PBA) introduced legislation to the Oregon House (HB2963) to legalize city laws limiting sitting or lying in public places. Portland\u2019s Sit/Lie Law was found to be unconstitutional in 2009, and was replaced by the slightly less Draconian Sidewalk Management Ordinance, but the PBA wants a return to the total ban on sitting or lying on the sidewalk. \r\nBeing cited under such laws often includes a fine that people living unhoused often cannot pay, compounding barriers for them to return to financial stability. Laws such as these also serve to push people experiencing homelessness into the shadows so that people who are housed do not have to think about the epidemic of poverty that exists around them. Silence and invisibility will not serve our community. A Homeless Bill of Rights in Oregon will protect our community from these attacks on human rights, build up our local and statewide anti-poverty movement, and educate people on the effects and causes of homelessness. We also hope that successful campaigns in California and Oregon will build momentum for Homeless Bills of Rights in states across the United States.\r\nFor the past several years, Sisters has been working to become a collectively managed organization. While we still have an Executive Director, each team is co-managed by team members. As a co-managed organization, we understand the importance of all people in a community sharing power. We intentionally seek out leadership from our community base. We train our community in using Sisters\u2019 meeting guidelines (meant to create a respectful space and encourage balanced participation from all people) and making decisions by consensus. Community members can also attend other trainings through this campaign, some of which teach lobbying, working with the media, base-building, and other important campaign skills. We know people from our community are the best leaders for the anti-homelessness and anti-poverty movements, and we strive to provide these people with the skills they need to take on those leadership roles. \r\n",

    "narrative4": "The primary goal of this campaign is to pass a Homeless Bill of Rights in Oregon in 2014. Secondary goals include strengthening the anti-poverty movement by building ally relationships, and educating the general populace about issues faced by people living unhoused. \r\n\r\nThe Street Outreach Committee continues to gather surveys from people experiencing homelessness, with a focus on people outside of the Portland Metro area. These surveys will inform the final bill by gathering information, input and experiences from people living unhoused. The Organizational Outreach Committee is seeking out additional supportive organizations to endorse and/or get involved with the campaign. Again, the current focus is on outreach outside the metro area. Our goal is to sign up 180 organizations in support of the HBR. The Communications Committee is working to spread the word about the campaign through social media, and is developing common talking points in conjunction with the California HBR campaign. Ally group Right 2 Survive has already produced a 3-part radio show for their monthly KBOO show about the campaign, interviewing organizers, participants and houseless people not currently engaged in the campaign about the effort. The Education Committee is building the campaign\u2019s messaging plan, including incorporating WRAP\u2019s Without Housing toolkit (which documents the 30-year decline of funding for affordable housing) as an educational tool, and Portand Copwatch\u2019s \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d materials. This committee is also planning community forums to inform our community of what the bill will and won\u2019t do. The Legislative/Legal Committee is working with chief legislative sponsor Representative Michael Dembrow on plans to secure more support for the bill from other legislators. \r\n\r\nBill concepts are due in September 2013 for the 2014 session. The Legislative/Legal Committee hopes to have a strong working draft of the legislation by that time.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Sisters is a founding member of the Western Regional Advocacy Project (WRAP), a regional social justice coalition of organizations along the West Coast that are determined to make ending homelessness a national priority.  WRAP members are building a movement for economic human rights through the campaigns Without Housing (focused on affordable housing) and Without Rights (focused on civil rights for people experiencing extreme poverty). Sisters helped in the research and writing of reports used in both these campaigns. These campaigns work hand in hand to stop the street-level disregard for poor people\u2019s civil and human rights, and to pressure the federal government to reinvest in affordable housing programs. WRAP is helping to coordinate Oregon\u2019s HBR campaign and a concurrent HBR campaign in California, with the hope of creating a national trend toward recognizing the rights of people living unhoused. Sisters\u2019 staff and community members participate in weekly calls with WRAP, and travel to its San Francisco headquarters periodically for face-to-face campaign planning meetings.\r\nSisters is a member of the Assembly to End Poverty, which emerged from the 2010 US Social Forum. Director Monica Beemer is co-chair, along with Marian Kramer, of the Assembly. Sisters\u2019 Health Advocate Michael Moore is on the Fundraising and Finance Committee. The Assembly has been convening People\u2019s Movement Assemblies across the US, bringing thousands of people together to develop strategies to fight poverty. Sisters has been able to send several community members to these events. The Assembly has also supported World Courts of Women on Poverty (led by Poor People\u2019s Economic Human Rights Campaign\u2014PPEHRC\u2014of which Sisters is also a member). Board member TwoBears was honored by being appointed as a juror in the Court held in May 2012. The Assembly is currently building toward the 2014 USSF.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Sisters is committed to creating a community in which all people are welcomed and valued. Sisters consciously works to be an anti-oppressive and anti-racist organization, not only interrupting the violence of oppressions whenever we see it, but also examining our structure to see where it is just and inclusive and where we need to grow as individuals and as an organization. Sisters also realizes the interconnectedness of oppressions, and the importance of recognizing and owning privilege where we have it. We strive to keep open communication with our community regarding oppression and privilege, and these topics are discussed frequently in our biweekly morning Coffee Talks\u2014one time we gather valuable input from our community. We understand the importance of developing with our community common language and understanding of concepts like oppression, privilege, homophobia and racism, in order to have these discussions.\r\nRacial justice is a vital piece of Sisters\u2019 ongoing work, though admittedly there is still work that needs to be done. Our new 3-year plan (consensed on this month) has four primary goals, one of which is that Sisters will \u201cuse racial justice filters as a measure in all our decisions and actions across our entire organization.\u201d Our Racial Justice/Anti-Oppressions work group is currently researching a group that will lead our organization through a two-year dismantling racism process, and our Development Team is working to secure designated funding for this process. We held our first People of Color Caucus for staff and community members a few weeks ago, in order to create space to discuss how Sisters could be a better ally to POC.\r\nSisters also works closely with ally organizations such as VOZ and CAUSA that are led by people of color and/or working on issues important to our community like immigration. \r\n",

Being cited for survival acts like sitting on the sidewalk, camping in public places, or even sharing food in public can come with a fine and even jail time. For folks living in extreme poverty, fines are generally unpayable and add to the difficulty of returning to a stable life. Criminal records can make finding employment extremely difficult. These types of challenges could be avoided or reduced if our society stopped criminalizing homelessness. Oregon\u2019s Homeless Bill of Rights will address these wrongs by protecting people who are or appear to be homeless from such unjust laws. While the HBR will not be a panacea that ends homelessness, it will be a great step toward providing necessary legal protection for a vulnerable class of people. This HBR campaign is being led by people from our community who have identified this bill as an important step in ensuring the rights of unhoused people. ",

Through building a powerful movement of community, faith and labor partners, we bring about stronger democracy, better jobs, racial equity, a healthy environment, and thriving communities. The Seattle Alliance for Good Jobs and Housing for Everyone (SAGE) was formed in 2001 as a coalition of labor, faith and community organizations. SAGE began by assisting efforts of low-wage hotel and janitorial workers to win a better standard of living for their families. In 2006, SAGE built and led a coalition of 17 organizations that won community benefits in exchange for up zoning new downtown Seattle development. In 2007 SAGE was expanded as Puget Sound Sage (standing for \u201cwisdom\u201d in policy choices) with a regional focus on the metro Seattle area, joining the national Partnership for Working Families (PWF). \r\n\u2022\tSince our inception, Sage has developed a track record for affordable housing advocacy and bringing a critical yet constructive analysis to planning and development policy. \r\n\u2022\tIn 2008, Sage led a community coalition to win the first Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) in metro Seattle on the Goodwill/Dearborn St. project, a $350 million mixed-use project near downtown Seattle. \r\n\u2022\tIn 2009-2010, Sage led a green jobs coalition that won a community workforce agreement (CWA) for a major commercial energy efficiency retrofit project in downtown Seattle, and set community hiring standards for residential energy efficiency projects funded by the City of Seattle. \r\n\u2022\tSage currently leads a community/labor partnership working for good jobs and clean air at the Port of Seattle, drawing national attention to sweatshop conditions and toxic diesel pollution from port trucks.\r\n\u2022\tIn 2012, Sage released major reports on working conditions at SeaTac Airport and downtown hotels, Walmart\u2019s jobs impact, and equitable transit-oriented development.  \r\n",

    "narrative3": "1. Clean Air in the Duwamish: Seaport air pollution disproportionately impacts low income and communities of color.  Emissions from thousands of diesel truck trips to the Port of Seattle primarily affect residents of the Duwamish Valley. The Duwamish Valley and the Tacoma Tideflats have had some of the highest levels of particulate matter in the region.  Such high levels of air pollution correspond with negative health impacts.  Communities near the Port have the highest asthma hospitalization for children under 18 in the entire county.  This is confirmed by resident reports.  When Sage conducted a community health survey in 2009, 60% of residents of port-adjacent neighborhoods believed port trucking negatively affected their health.\r\n\r\n2. Equitable and Sustainable Transit Oriented Development (TOD) in the Rainier Valley:  TOD around light rail stations has the potential to bring sustainability, healthy neighborhoods, and prosperity to low income and communities of color in the Rainier Valley.  In 2012 Sage released a report, \"Transit Related Development that\u2019s Healthy, Green and Just,\" which examined the environment, causes and solutions for the equity gap in southeast Seattle and south King County.  Our research team found strong evidence of gentrification threatening to displace communities of color and low income residents in Rainier Valley.  Multiple factors make households susceptible for displacement, including concentrated poverty, many renters, high foreclosure rates, high unemployment, and low-wage jobs. Displacement not only threatens existing south Seattle communities. It also undermines the promise and opportunity for environmental sustainability and economic prosperity that Transit Oriented Development (TOD) offers residents of our region.  \r\n\r\nBuilding labor and community movements is core to Sage\u2019s theory of change.  We play a unique role in bring together labor, community, faith and environmental organizations to build a lasting movement for social change.  Our Ports Campaign is partnering with local unions, faith and community groups to support port workers who are seeking to win living wages, job retention and benefits, while winning cleaner air for communities.  Our Community Benefits and Development Campaign is working to ensure that low income and communities of color have a seat at decision making tables concerning economic development and transit access in the Rainier Valley.   In both these campaigns we will build alignment among regional progressive entities that focuses on long-term power building and agenda setting rather than short-term campaign wins.  We will strengthen our relationships with a growing circle of trusted allies in the environmental, immigrant rights, faith, housing and other sectors and leverage those relationships to be a stronger, collective political force to build a coalition that works together on a progressive pro-labor and community agenda.  As a result, we will drive a more ambitious policy agenda\u2014for worker organizing and achieving urgent environmental and housing goals.\r\n",

Our follow-up goal is to help local communities build social and political power to advocate for mitigation strategy and public policy changes that lower diesel emissions and improve public health in in their communities. \r\n\r\n2. In order to ensure that TOD benefits rather than displaces low income communities, it is vital that south end neighborhoods work together collectively to build power.

Our partners in the South CORE alliance include One America, The Filipino Community of Seattle, The African Diaspora, El Centro de la Raza, Asian Counseling and Referral Service, InterIm, Rainier Beach Community Empowerment Coalition, Got Green and many others.

Our strategic plan completed in November 2012 calls for a multi-year program of racial justice training and program development, which includes the adoption of organizational policy for staff and board diversity as well as a program for the active recruitment, training and support of leaders of color. Our staff and board are over-representative of people of color compared to the community as a whole.\r\n\r\nOur initiatives seek not only to make tangible gains in wages, benefits, quality of life and policy, but we seek to help constituencies to build the political and social power to fight for real change in their own lives.  One of the ways we do this is through leadership development.  We seek always to place the people directly affected by the issues in the driver\u2019s seat of our organizing work by cultivating their leadership, and by investing in them through training and leadership opportunities.  We also work in close partnership with organizations and alliances representing the interest of diverse communities in the region.

JwJ has utilized a variety of strategies and tactics to support a broad range of workers\u2019 rights and community social justice campaigns.  We have helped thousands of workers in our community win a union or improve their lives. The rest of our work consists of broader organizing around economic justice. We have been a key part of passing Minimum and Living Wage policies in Oregon and Multnomah County. We were also one of the lead organizations in turning folks out for the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in 1999 and we continue to lead coalition-building efforts around fighting corporate globalization. We helped pass the City of Portland's Sweatfree ordinance; our health care committee got resolutions supporting single payer health care passed by both the County and the City. We continue to organize educational events around immigrant worker issues for the labor movement. Portland Jobs with Justice (JwJ) is the primary labor community coalition in Multnomah County. We are a long-term multi-issue coalition and a key place where the labor movement and the community come together in an ongoing way.  Portland Jobs with Justice is comprised of ninety labor, community, environmental, student, social justice and religious groups working together to defend the rights of working people and to demand social and economic justice.  We bring together a wide spectrum of groups, from the anti-war Portland Peaceful Response Coalition to the Carpenters and Teamsters.  We focus on abuse of civil rights and the struggles of exploited workers and their communities, especially people of color, immigrants, and women.

    "narrative3": "Our organization believes that the root causes of human suffering exist in a capitalist economic system. This is why it is we engage in struggles that work to dismantle this economic system. Our analysis is that corporate America has been taking advantage of working people and that we need a mass social movement to limit their power. We have seen the depths of this power in the recent LIBOR scandal and know that elected officials are not going to hold those who have committed this fraud accountable without a mass social movement. We build this movement locally by supporting collective bargaining struggles, demanding health care as a human right, fighting for just treatment of immigrant workers, standing in solidarity with global struggles and organizing with the local faith community. Our organization builds collective power to do this on two fronts. Primarily, as a coalition, we organize other member organizations such as unions and faith groups to work together in supporting each others struggles. This work is done by educating our member organizations and making formal requests for support. Additionally, we organize those who have signed our \"I'll be there\" pledge, which asks community members to come out in support to five different events other than their own during the year. These tools allow us the ability to organize for mass direct action, which we believe is essential in making change. We believe that by organizing mass direct action in the work areas we are focused in that we can build pressure on the supporting institutions such as banks, the Sheriff's office and the Oregon legislature to make fundamental change. This work has the ability to make banks change loans for individuals and to pay back communities. This work has the ability to save families from being torn apart by bad immigration laws and this work has the ability to save people from economic distress due to a health issue that arises and the ability to create a health care system that supports all people in the community.

Our overall goal for our Global Justice work is to oppose the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal. Our primary work to engage faith communities this year will be to continue engaging with the Wage Theft Campaign, helping to bring wage theft issues to congregations. Our health care work is about organizing a movement to fight for universal health care.

Our more active partners include labor, such as UNITE HERE which represents hotel and restaurant workers, SEIU which represents both public workers and private sector workers such as janitors and health care workers we also work with UFCW which represents grocery workers. In immigrant rights we work closely with Voz, and the Dreamers,  with two Voz executive members on our executive committee. We have also built a strong relationship with Right 2 Dream 2. We have many strong relationships with Catholic and Unitarian churches in particular and our health care work engages Health Care for All Oregon in particular. There are several member organizations in particular we have identified we need to build deeper relationships with which are OPAL and Basic Rights Oregon. The purpose of our coalition and these relationships is to build deep, meaningful, long lasting relationships with organizations and people that are not transactional. As a coalition, because we support the work of others and build campaigns that support community work, we have the unique ability to bring out the best in working relationships. Our role in relationship building is to find the common ground that brings us closer. By encouraging organizations to work together and being able to challenge institutional leaders to think beyond their bread and butter issues we are able to move organizations to a more progressive big picture. ", 
    "narrative6": "We believe that oppression is used as a tool by those in power to keep communities separate and un-organized and that this is seen as racism, homophobia, sexism, xenophobia and other forms abuse. Division is a tool of the boss and politician to reinforce an economic system with roots in slavery. In order to make real economic change we must do this by actively working to create communities across all lines based in our common struggles. As part of our organizing it is important to educate our broad and diverse coalition that we cannot be divided as workers. This has led us to be particularly engaged in educating building trades unionists about immigration issues as it relates to local day labor issues along the lines \"immigrant rights are workers rights\". As a primarily white-led organization Jobs with Justice works as an ally by making those connections. Additionally, we are a space to bring struggles to and ask for support which other organizations might traditionally not view as an economic struggle. For example, house less rights activists have been able to use Jobs with Justice to ask for mobilization support for actions when the city has moved to sue their organization. The call to support from Jobs with Justice has resulted in local public sector unions and others becoming involved in the struggle, because \"house less rights are workers rights\". Locally our Pride at Work chapter has become more involved in Jobs with Justice as well as the community. In the near future Oregon will take up the struggle for same sex marriage. This will mean organizing our member organization and pledgers that \"LGBTQ rights are workers rights.\" By refusing to be divided and actively working towards common goals we believe we can win campaigns. Lastly, as a coalition we are able to stand up and make calls to action when there communities are under attack. This could mean engaging in conversations around police brutality in the African American community or school closures that are happening in communities of color. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "The Puget Sound economy is growing once again, but low income workers, immigrants and communities of color are not benefiting from economic growth.  Area employers are improving their profitability by cutting labor costs and low income workers are paying a steep price.  At SeaTac Airport, passenger service, ground support and food & retail service workers work for poverty-level wages and lack adequate health insurance coverage.  Likewise seaport truckers are misclassified by their employers as contract workers when they meet the legal definition of full-time employees.  As a result they not only earn a poverty wage, but are forced into unhealthy work conditions that are the modern day equivalent of \u201csweatshops on wheels.\u201d\r\n\r\nLow income and communities of color are not only facing institutional injustice in the workforce they are also threatened by gentrification and displacement in the neighborhoods they live in.  Although people of color grew by 47 percent as a share of the population in King County, low income people in the neighborhoods of the Rainier Valley grew by only 5 percent, while the white population grew by 17 percent.  Economic growth anticipated along the light rail line in the valley threatens to displace low income communities of color whose incomes will not keep up as real estate costs rise. Multiple factors make Rainier Valley households susceptible for displacement, including concentrated poverty, high numbers of renters, high rates of foreclosure, high unemployment, and over-representation in low-wage jobs.\r\n\r\nBuilding the labor movement is core to Sage\u2019s theory of change.  We play a unique role in bring together labor, community, faith and environmental organizations to build lasting movements for social change.  Our Goods Movement and Ports Campaign is partnering with local unions to support airport and seaport workers who are seeking to unionize, negotiate contracts and pass public policies that promote living wage jobs, job retention and benefits.  Our Community Benefits and Development Campaign is working to ensure that low income and communities of color have a seat at decision making tables concerning economic development and transit access in the Rainier Valley.   In both these campaigns we will build alignment among regional progressive entities that focuses on long-term power building and agenda setting rather than short-term campaign wins.  We will strengthen our relationships with a growing circle of trusted allies in the environmental, immigrant rights, faith, housing and other sectors and leverage those relationships to be a stronger, collective political force to build a coalition that works together on a progressive pro-labor and community agenda.  As a result, we will drive a more ambitious policy agenda\u2014for worker organizing and achieving urgent environmental and housing goals.",

Our collective goal is to build a strong alliance of community representatives that are committed to building power for constituencies along the light rail, and who will work together to ensure that low-income and immigrant communities are represented at the decision-making tables.\r\n\r\n Sage's entire staff meets twice a year to evaluate our progress and effectiveness in meeting our goals and objectives, with a further review done by Sage's board twice a year. At these time we evaluate the success of our strategies in meeting our objectives and identify additional activities or changes in approach in order to meet our overall goals.", 
    "narrative5": "We believe that labor, community, faith and environmental organizations must step outside silos to create a new movement for social change.   We recognize that we will only \u201cwin\u201d if we change the political landscape in our region and that none of us are powerful enough by ourselves. Sage specializes in devising and running campaigns that align interests that haven\u2019t always worked together before. In so doing, we change the regional power map and accrue more power for workers on the job and in the community.  The South-Core Alliance described above is an example of how we are working to shift the power map.

    "narrative6": "Addressing racial and economic injustice is core to our organizational mission.  We have made a commitment to adopting a racial justice lens in our work and are actively incorporating racial justice principles and practices into our organization (e.g. board and staff diversity, leadership development), and our campaigns (issues, strategy, recruiting, training, coalition-building, messaging, research and actions).  Our strategic plan completed in November 2012 calls for a multi-year program of racial justice training and program development, which includes the adoption of organizational policy for staff and board diversity as well as a program for the active recruitment, training and support of leaders of color. \r\n\r\nOur initiatives seek not only to make tangible gains in wages, benefits, quality of life and policy, but we seek to help constituencies build the political and social power to fight for real change in their own lives.  One of the ways we do this is through leadership development.  We seek always to place the people directly affected by the issues in the driver\u2019s seat of our organizing work by cultivating their leadership, and by investing in them through training and leadership opportunities.  We also work in close partnership with organizations and alliances representing the interests of diverse communities in the region. Our close partnerships with Rainier Beach Community Empowerment Coalition (RBCEC), Got Green, One America, Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition, Vietnamese Friendship Association and similar groups are great examples of our movement-building work.

    "narrative1": "The Just Garden Projects' gardening and nutrition programs are based on the idea that we can heal ourselves and our communities. We work one-on-one with low income residents (income at or below 200% of the poverty line) to help them gain self sufficiency and empowerment surrounding their food.\r\n\r\nThe Just Garden Project was founded in 2010 by Stephanie Seliga, who was struggling to afford nutritious food for her family while on EBT. She supplemented her food budget by growing food at home, and believed other families would also benefit from this knowledge. During the first year, 250 volunteers for Just Garden Project built nine free gardens - that's 18,000 sq ft of food production space - for low-income families. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, Just Garden Project surveyed constituents and found that gardeners were not as successful maintaining gardens in year two. Two elements were added to the program to increase food production: 1.) Implemented a modest $25 fee for each garden; garden recipients who paid a small portion were more likely to continue using their gardens after the first growing season; 2.) Added the \"Gardener for Life.\" This yearlong program costs $45, and it covers soil science, organic plant care and toxin reduction, and nutritious cooking from the garden.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Just Garden Project added an additional component, a free four session garden introduction series for all garden recipients. In late 2012, Just Garden Project became a program of Seattle Tilth, which has improved our organizational infrastructure and given us more resources to support our programs. \r\n\r\nSince the first garden build, Just Garden Project has built over 70 gardens for low-income families. We estimate that each garden grows up to $650 in fresh, local vegetables. That's over $45,000 in local, organic food that supports the people who most need fresh, healthy food.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Just Garden Project addresses the issue of food access to healthy, affordable food. In King County, 9% of our community,180,000 people, receive food stamp assistance. According to Communities Count, SNAP caseloads increased by 83% between 2009 and 2011 and food bank use is up by 113,000 households.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, our processed food system degrades our our health through cheap, processed foods with low nutritional value. Food access is further complicated by multiple problems within low-income communities: limited number of grocery stores; fewer fresh produce options; and food banks supplying processed food or foods that people don't know how to prepare.   \r\n\r\nOur community-based solutions support self-sufficient and empower individuals working toward ending hunger, and increasing health and positive environmental strategies. We believe that the power dynamic in our food system can be changed through grassroots work. \r\n\r\nJust Garden Project operates with a three pronged approach: 1.) People make a small investment in gardens; 2.) They learn to grow food through experimentation, mentorship, and our two educational series; 3.) They learn to cook nutritious food in the educational series. Just by doing this, they change their economic connection to food and their health.  \r\n\r\nPast Just Garden Project recipients report:\r\n\r\n1.\t45% increase in access to fresh produce\r\n2.\t44% increase in amount of fresh vegetables consumed each day\r\n3.\t26% decrease in consumption of pre-packaged meals\r\n4.\t39% decrease in reliance on food bank\r\n5.\t13% decrease in reported hunger or missing meals\r\n6.\t95% reported sharing garden yields with members of their community\r\n\r\nPowerful community change takes place when people unite around food access. Because food is a shared need, it ignites people to take action. Our garden beds are built collectively on specific days through the year, and each day is an event and celebration. Hundreds of volunteers work alongside garden recipients, and celebrate together at the end of the day. Garden recipients who take our garden and nutrition education programs become mentors in their community and inspire others to get involved. We've recently seen the effects of this peer-to-peer activity: after we built gardens in the SHA High Point community, we began getting calls from people in Delridge, who want to start this program in their own community. They'd heard about and seen what was going on, and wanted to be part of the movement. \r\n\r\nGiven tools and education, people are self-sufficient. Gardeners can supplement their diet with healthy, nutritious foods and they do not need to rely on food banks, low-nutrition food, or overpriced grocery stores. They can share the food they grow with their community, and inspire others to make grassroots changes to radically alter the economic structure around food and food access. \r\n",

We also took on our first AmeriCorps member, who has been instrumental in helping to expand our programs. We have already launched our first spring build, which was hugely successful. \r\n\r\nIn July 2013, Just Garden Project will have our first ever summer build, in Burien. Because demand is increasing, we are also increasing the number of times that we provide outreach. We have been approached by a group of community members who are eager to start gardens in their neighborhood. Like our other events, this will be done by volunteers and will focus on community celebration. \r\nThroughout the winter quarters, we will continue to teach and recruit new candidates for the 2014 spring build \u2013 which is our largest garden build event of the year. We will also continue to survey past garden recipients and learn how to make the project more successful for them.\r\n\r\nThe spring build in May 2014 will be our largest to date and we will celebrate having built over 100 gardens around King County! We will continue to fine tune our educational programming, and we would like to deepen our regular connection to program participants. Through intake surveys and outtake surveys, we are able to determine the impact that the gardens are having on people's lives, food security, and health. We use these surveys each year to decide how we can make the program even better. \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Just Garden Project has worked with more than 20 community focused organizations for social change. These have included Community Alliance for Global Justice (CAGJ), Chancery Place, Rainier Valley Food Bank, Seattle Housing Authority and United Indians of all Tribes Foundation.\r\n \r\nWe help build sustained community and connection around nutrition and food production. One of our most lasting relationships is with The United Indians of all Tribes Foundation home for youth, Labateyah. Four years ago we built a garden at Labateyah, and each year our connection has grown. We collaborate monthly, providing educational tools, helping Labateyah incorporate the garden into the culture of the home, and helping host a traditional Salish food ceremony and potlatch. The Chancery Place Garden was an early partnership with Catholic Community Services and P-Patch. Residents have continued strong and positive relationships with the Just Garden Project and continue to volunteer. \r\n\r\nJust Garden Project works with community in the way that best fits individual or organization needs. We can support by:  building gardens, educating staff or hosting workshops. We can also help: establish a community based culture of garden; establish governance systems for garden care; organize volunteers or evaluate outcomes.  \r\n\r\nFood access has gained nationwide attention. Unlike many huge and overwhelming issues, people can wrap their minds and arms around something as basic as having enough to eat. Gardening is a place where the personal is political. It is also innately apolitical; conservatives often like the boot strap nature of gardening and liberals can get behind building a community where we can all access the food that we need. The Just Garden Project demonstrates that we can come together with an effective, inexpensive model that builds food security for people of all backgrounds and experiences. ", 
    "narrative6": "Food justice is intrinsically linked to racial justice and to economic justice. Though access to healthy food should be a basic right, it varies according to income and community. According to the USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Services (FNS), a household\u2019s chances of being hungry or food-insecure decrease as income rises. Because poverty is racialized, people of color are more likely to suffer from food insecurity. In Washington State, 88% of impoverished people and 57% of EBT recipients are people of color. \r\n\r\nThe City of Seattle Food Action Plan states that:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn King County, 20% of children and 14% percent of all residents are food insecure\r\n\u2022\tLow-income,  African-American, Native American and Latino people are more likely to run out of food and more likely to have diabetes\r\n\u2022\tLow-cost, low-nutrition food is marketed to and more widely sold in communities that are African American, Latino, Native American, and low-income\r\n\r\nNumerous studies show that quality of food varies by geographic and economic community. A study in The American Journal of Public Health found that healthy foods like whole-grains, fresh fruits and vegetables are often less available or more expensive in low-income communities.  Supermarkets, which offer low-cost quality produce, are half as likely to be in predominately minority communities.\r\n\r\nThe cost of living in Seattle has pushed many low-income people further north and south of the city. Many of these people are immigrants who are living in centralized communities, and often, they do not drive or have access to a car. They have difficulty reaching a supermarket that has higher quality food. \r\n\r\nSmaller corner stores or grocery stores, which are more common in low-income, racially diverse communities, are more likely to feature processed foods and pre-packaged meals that are high in calories, but low in nutrition. This is one reason that obesity and diabetes is prevalent in low-income communities. \r\n\r\nThe Just Garden Project works with low-income people, regardless of their background, race or ethnicity. We help people connect with their food and take pleasure in growing, cooking and eating healthy, affordable food. By growing food right in their neighborhood, they are also inspiring a conversation about what kinds of foods are available locally and seasonally.  \r\n\r\nWhile the Just Garden Project is a primarily white-led organization, we are diverse in other ways, and are working to become a more diverse organization. Seattle Tilth, our parent organization, has prioritized Board diversity as a strategic goal.  Our Council and staff include people who are low-income and respect our constituents. A program participant always sits on our Council. We believe that we must listen, honor, and follow the needs and desires of our community partners, so that each group can take charge of their own food system. ",

    "cycle_question": "As stated above, it is impossible in our society to separate race, class and economics. Due to segregation, redlining, immigration standards, people\u2019s background is regularly linked to their economic status. Seattle\u2019s cost living index is more than 100% against the national average. \r\n\r\nWith this isolation and racial segregation,  In our most recent garden build, at the SHA homes in High Point, qualifying household income to live in SHA housing is $18,500 for an individual and $26,400 for a household of four. The income per capita in High Point is 64.9% less than the Seattle average. According to King County Public Health, 34-84% of people who live in High Point live in poverty.\r\n\r\nThis is also the story for much of South Seattle, which was populated from the 1950\u2019s through the 1970\u2019s with a high volume of subsidized housing complexes. Business owners were not putting in stores in these communities, especially not grocery stores. South Seattle has been so impacted that community groups have tested several food strategies such as developing healthy corner stores or box grocery stores.  \r\n\r\nWe believe that the Just Garden Project model works outside that economic capitalist system. Rather than compelling large supermarkets that they should set up shop in these communities, we\u2019re helping the communities take charge of their own health and economic well-being. We\u2019re advocating for a model in which people are growing enough food to supplement their needs. We do not advocate for eliminating food banks or continuing to build a strong and vibrant community in low-income regions. But we do believe that this model provides an out, an alternative, a powerful addition so that people feel secure in knowing that they could find their next meal just outside, in their backyard, or community garden, or the courtyard of their apartment building.  \r\n",

It started with a series of local and statewide campaigns that tied green building standards on school and government buildings with apprentice utilization requirements for at risk youth and disadvantaged constituencies.  \r\n\r\nThe IAF Northwest then launched a successful pilot project in Spokane to create new jobs in retrofitting nonprofit buildings and older, moderate income owned homes.  Based on that success, the Alliances recently:\r\n\uf09f\tLed a statewide campaign to secure passage of legislation (called \u201cthe most comprehensive and groundbreaking green jobs legislation of our time\u201d) that directed $15 million into creating new community-based energy efficiency retrofit programs.\r\n\uf09f\tSpun its pilot project -- SustainableWorks -- into a subsidiary non-profit that has done over $6 million in home retrofits business in the past 3 years (approximately 2,000 audits and 700 whole-house retrofits) and employs over 200 people in high quality jobs directly and though sub-contractors. \r\n\uf09f\tSecured key votes in a statewide legislative campaign in 2012 that puts $1.1 billion over the next 3 years into capital and environmental infrastructure projects, including another $15 million into energy efficiency retrofit programs.\r\n\uf09f\tObtained commitments from Spokane's Public Facilities District around job quality standards, apprentice utilization and local hiring / materials purchasing for the upcoming expansion of the convention center and arena.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the leadership capacity and lessons learned in those campaigns, the Spokane and Sound Alliances are making a major pivot to begin addressing the wide range of issues related to budget cuts at the local and statewide levels.  The Spokane Alliance has already been successful in helping pass a library levy and in shifting the debate about proposed cuts to citywide services.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Washington state residents face serious problems.  Trust in government is close to its all time low and anti-tax sentiments \u2013 due in part to the most regressive tax structure in the US \u2013 remain high.  At the same time, the courts are requiring billions of dollars in needed investments in public education, putting enormous pressure on a state budget already cut by over $10 B in recent years, with cascading impacts on local governments.  Residents, of course are feeling the brunt with cuts to transportation, childcare and human services, tuition increases, larger class sizes reduced access to parks and libraries, etc.\r\n\r\nThe political will to tackle the problem head-on has been limited by the success of anti-tax initiatives and the siloing of constituencies looking out for only themselves (not to mention decades of well-funded efforts by those interested in shrinking the role of government, reducing high income taxes and \u201cprofitizing\u201d government services).\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the tasks of shifting public attitudes about the role of government and generating the political will to address major revenue challenges will not be done through traditional media and mobilizing campaigns alone. The 2010 high earners income tax initiative, for example, was launched with support at 58% and fell to 36% after seven months and $13 million in media expenditures. \r\n\r\nThe Spokane Alliance, in contrast, conducted a campaign to pass a local option sales tax to fund community transit in 2004 that pivoted on the development of more durable \u201cjudgments\u201d.   The effort engaged over 200 Alliance leaders in successful negotiations with the Transit Authority over how the money would be spent and how the Transit Authority would be held accountable. Confident that the money would be well spent, those leaders contacted 3,500 voters face-to-face and another 7,000 by phone, resulting in:\r\n\u2022\ta 69 -31% victory\r\n\u2022\tincreasing voter turnout by 11,713 (over the 2002 regular September primary when the previous measure lost  48 \u2013 52 %)\r\n\u2022\tdoubling the number of people who based their votes on \u201cword of mouth\u201d recommendations from neighbors and friends \u2013 to 21,218 voters. \r\nThe alliances will employ a similar strategy to address the confidence/revenue crisis facing government entities in Washington.  The 2 \u00bd year Resorting Washington\u2019s Future will build on the swing district targeting and engagement strategy that was successful in the earlier jobs campaigns and initiate a new organizing strategy \u2013 Neighbors for Good - to replicate the experience of the Spokane transit campaign many times over. \r\n",

The focus will shift to: developing a collective vision for the state; popular education about state budgets, revenue options and power dynamics; and developing a policy platform going into the 2014 fall elections.\r\n\r\nQuantitatively, the success of the strategy will be measured by the numbers of:\r\n\u2022\tleaders who are trained and engage in a campaigns;\r\n\u2022\tneighbors for good groups started / people participating;\r\n\u2022\tallied groups engaged;\r\n\u2022\tlocal campaign actions carried out; and \r\n\u2022\tpeople involved in developing a collective vision for the state.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "The IAF Northwest and its affiliates work to build the progressive power base in several ways. First, they unite a diverse set of previously siloed constituencies into ongoing relationships within their own broad-based membership structure.  The mix of faith, labor, education and community-based organizations within the IAF Northwest affiliated organizations are among the most diverse of any institution-based organizations in the country. \r\n\r\nThe Northwest IAF affiliated Alliances also have a strong track record of working with other progressive organizations to achieve more significant change. In Washington, the Alliances have consistently partnered with a wide range of organizations on specific issue campaigns. These efforts have gone beyond respectful partnering relationships within the context of the campaign to include things such as opening IAF Northwest and local affiliate training to other organizations and supporting the development of unaffiliated organizers. The opportunities to expand these relationships in the revenue and health care campaigns are enormous (and necessary).\r\n\r\nThe roles the Alliances play vary depending on the nature of the partnership and the challenge of the campaign.  In a recent Jobs Bill victory, for example, the Washington State labor Council did nearly all of the traditional lobbying effort at the state Capitol while the alliances focused on working in local legislative districts to secure the critical support of conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans.  The Sound Alliance also used the relationship it had developed with state Treasurer in foreclosure prevention campaign to help remove his opposition to the sale of state funds to fund a stimulus package.\r\n",

They have also made racial criteria a key element in targeted hiring requirements for all of the jobs and apprentice utilization campaigns undertaken in the last 10 years.  The Sound Alliance is currently involved in a campaign to address problems at the Tacoma detention center in the ongoing policy based biases against immigrants by local law enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these campaign activities, the Alliances continually work to engage the diversity of their communities and a designer local leadership institutes to maximize the opportunities for people to break down barriers based on race, gender, sexual orientation and ability.\r\n",

    "narrative5": "African American Breastfeeding Coalition, formed by Multnomah Health Dept and International Center for Traditional Childbearin and Doula Caribe among others, this coalition is working to build the movement in Oregon where everyone have the right to know about traditional childbearing, to have a birth companion (Doula), to end health disparities. The TREE has been supporting the movement by engaging African American, Native Americans and  Latinas to work together and creating theater skits to engage the public at large, with great success so far.\r\n\r\nCHARLA, Collective Health Advocacy & Rights of Latinas/os, Africans & Allies, a collective of Latinas/os and African/African Americans of small grassroots organizations/groups to engage and develop leadership and advocacy for policy change. Our principle is that Equity and Social Justice can be achieved when community members have the power and are enable to advocate on their on behalf. We use Popular Education.  In 2012 CHARLA included organizations of Allies (Portland Jobs with Justice, Occupy Portland) to create community events where All races and ethnicity are invited to interact and face biases that prevent us to achieve equity. The TREE Institute is the coordinator, organizer, and seeker of funds.  \r\n\r\nHealth Care for All-Oregon (HCAO) is a statewide coalition with over 60 members organizations (The-TREE institute is one of them), founded in January 2012 to work for Universal Health Care (Single Payer). HCAO is our strategy to overcome divide and rule opponents against health care for everyone, based on 6 principles (equity, universality, transparency, participation, accountability, public good) and using Vermont state strategy of Health Care as Human Right to build a large grassroots movement, including immigrants. The TREE is one of the two only Latino immigrants members currently committed to the development of this movement, with a seat in the working HCAO Board of Directors.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Because economic injustice is one of the most accessible - people need to eat and have a roof over their heads- it one of the largest used forms of oppression in our societies. It is tough not easily recognized especially by those who practice it, even among those people who may see themselves as friends. It is in fact, a form of keeping women (and men) of lower classes or less formally educated under control and serving one's needs as well as to enhance ones' wealthy life and or status quo.\r\n\r\nFrom our origins as Latinas and Latinos, we are also aware of such uses of human workforce and how economic injustice is a combination of racism and homophobia that many have that they could lose their status quo to new immigrants who might take their previous nice lives away, take their jobs positions, or who may be driving in their safe roads and provoking accidents, or...whatever. \r\n\r\nIt was in 2009, during the legislative session, while learning from a strong group of Health Reform Allies with the Oregon Health Action Campaign technical support, that we realized the importance of engaging them, the Allies, to share and learn from us as well. Since them, all of our community events are designed to receive and engage all ethnicity or identified races and groups. And, whenever we have some budget we invite Allies to be part of our programs. Materials and translation in Spanish are always offered to assure that everyone can understand the subjects and participate at collective decisions. We provide food and child care, so that Moms can fully participate too.\r\n\r\nThe TREE programs uses Pedagogy of the Oppressed (aka Popular Education) and Theatre of the Oppressed, where the oppressed become actors of their own life and needs, in order to put immigrants at the center of this debate. Despite of controversial and adverse reactions by the public and even our partners these social theories and techniques give to the marginalized the opportunity to transform the social status quo. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, in order to assure that our members, specially Latinas/os, seek for leadership positions and face the challenges to work with Allies, leadership development is encouraged for everyone who is committed to be active no matter of formal education (e.g., a seasonal farm worker who cannot read and write in Spanish or English said during our 2011 evaluation meeting: \u201cnow, after 10 months of a  CHARLA member I feel comfortable to eat with you all, and to talk with legislators\u201d).  For instance, we encourage all our members to participate at Allies coalitions, governmental Committees and task forces, such as OHA/Office of Equity and Inclusion, and at Oregon Health Policy Board meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "Colectivo MUJER, Mujeres Unidas por la Justicia Economica y Racial is our strategy to open up spaces at the workforce market for the highly capable population of Latinas living and working in Oregon! Economic Justice is about to acknowledge every one as a person capable to contribute to the society, and received a just payment for that contribution. \r\n\r\nDespite of their needed contribution, Latinas are at the extreme bottom of the workforce pyramid in this country. For instance Oregon economy cannot go back to what its old 100 years ago structure and succeed without this extended hidden network of housekeepers, nanies, janitors, and cooks, who like ants, never stop. However they are the least recognized for Oregon economy, through lowest wages and poor housing. Yet, they are the ones who contribute and assure that a majority Caucasian population can go tho their well paid jobs and have a wealthy life. Latinas are always reminded as good cooks for community events with their tasty food and ability to cook for many with their kids and husband support, but very few pay them as a recognized Chef!\r\n\r\nAnd who are the best community health caregivers? Who are known as great herbal medicines knowledgeable, passed from generation to generation by their moms and abuelitas (grandmothers)? Latinas! Moreover, Oregon already count with a new generation of Latina students, professors, highly educated, and professionals that still are left to be the last chosen when it comes to \"whom can represent Latino communities\"?\r\n\r\nColectivo MUJER was born from these mixed feelings of strength and weakness, proud and oppression, happiness and sadness, but also from critical consciousness about the complementary function of those feelings, that make us move mountains, and face the challenges to demonstrate that we Latinas are going to make Economic Justice happen! \r\n\r\n\r\n",

While Asians and Pacific Islanders are the 2nd largest and 2nd fastest growing populations in our state, our community faces barriers across diverse languages, cultures and immigration experiences.  Of the new arrival Oregonians, Asians comprise the vast majority through refugee resettlement from Burma, Bhutan and Iraq.  Theories such as the model minority stereotype promotes the notion that we are all experience prosperity when the facts demonstrate persistent disparities.  Disaggregated data shows deep disparities within API communities in areas of health, education, jobs and more.  Anti-immigrant racism and barriers to public institutions and benefits have a significant impact particularly on newcomer immigrants and refugees who experience higher rates of poverty and lack of education.\r\n\r\nAsians and Pacific Islanders of Oregon are our primary constituency, and we continue to educate ourselves about the vast diversity of ethnicity, language, and immigration experience within our community and  the realities that face ethnic and language specific communities.  Those most affected include newcomers, particularly immigrants and refugees whose benefits have run out during their resettlement, limited or no English proficiency persons, and persons experiencing poverty.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the lack of economic justice, racial inequities in public policy and historic attitudes and beliefs of racial superiority to be root causes for the issues we face.

    "narrative1": "In 1995 homeless youth organized a concert (Peace for the Streets by Kids from the Streets) to raise awareness about the impacts of the Becca Bill, a truancy law with adverse impacts on youth who left home due to family crisis. The concert attracted 1,500 people and helped build momentum to modify the law to allow time to understand a young person\u2019s situation before sending them back to an unsafe home. The success of this effort inspired these young people to continue to bring awareness to issues impacting them.\r\nStarting out of her apartment, former teacher Elaine Simons began work with a cohort of youth who wanted to complete their education and learn to become effective advocates. Originally set up under the fiscal umbrella of the Seattle Neighborhood Group, PSKS was able to start receiving grants and donations to continue their work and move out of the apartment into a space on Capitol Hill. \r\nOver the next several years, Simons and her homeless students lobbied on many issues, both on the streets of Seattle and in the halls of state and local government. As they got more engaged, they also realized a need to provide services to fill unmet community needs. In order to secure funding for these programs, PSKS sought and secured its own 501(c) 3 status in 2000. The by-laws, with input from participants, established a governance structure that formalizes input and voting rights for CORE participants. \r\nPSKS continues to be engaged in issues adversely affecting homeless youth. Community wide initiatives to \u201cend homelessness\u201d impose a top-down approach that fails to acknowledge or address the underlying economic and social justice issues.

    "narrative3": "In 2008, PSKS became one of the first homeless youth centers in Seattle to collect demographics on sexual identity. Over the past 4 years nearly half of our participants have self-identified as LGBTQ a number extremely disproportionate to the 5-10% of the general population. So many young people when they come out are kicked out of their homes or leave because of abuse. Since 2011, PSKS has maintained an emergency fund to support the specific needs of queer homeless youth. \r\nWith funding from Pride Foundation, PSKS is currently modeling an empowerment/organizing approach to ensure that homeless LGBTQ youth have equal access to community services. Homeless LGBTQ youth currently serve in paid internships to gain community organizing and employment experience. The goal is to conduct need and asset surveys to identify community resources, opportunities and gaps and barriers to services that will help PSKS (and the community) more strategically meet the needs of the homeless LGBTQ population. PSKS workshops teach organizing skills in a social justice framework, and offer support to improve job seeking, resume writing and personal presentation skills. In doing outreach interns gain work experience, a credible reference and expand their support network.\r\nInterns first learned how to do a \u201ccommunity needs and assets\u201d assessment with the goal of collecting and evaluating data to make a plan to meet the needs of their community. During an early assessment, interns observed racial dynamics at play. In debriefing the situation staff and the interns talked about allyship. The interns decided to change their internship to conduct racial and cultural competence assessments to groups and organizations that a homeless queer young person would most likely navigate in Seattle. \r\nPSKS is modeling allyship by giving the young people the tools necessary to evaluate the services they have to navigate. Each assessment provides valuable experience for the interns and also grows connections for PSKS and within a growing community of LGBTQ homeless youth advocates and allies. Interns will have the opportunity to present the findings of the racial assessments to each organization with suggestions on how to improve the experience for Queer people of color.  An overall summary of the experience and their findings will also be presented.\r\nOne of the most interesting dynamics so far is reveals the deeply institutionalized nature of oppression. Some organizations have refused or resisted participating in the survey\u2014especially at administrative and management levels. Some of these agencies have been accessed by building relationships with program services staff. This initiative seems to bridge a gap between human services and a broader and more diverse and inclusive community of activists. PSKS is participating in the assessment as we continue to be open to ways to improve our services.",

    "narrative4": "Queer Youth Outreach Interns are an extension of our Lasting Employment Advancement Program (LEAP). This initiative provides a structured and supportive environment for homeless youth (ages 16-25) to enter the workforce. LEAP offers internship roles within the organization and community. Interns identify and track personal goals, participate in a series of workshops, and develop a resume and employment action plan. These positions fill real needs and help PSKS increase its capacity to achieve our mission. \r\nParticipants work part-time and receive a stipend and bus fare for the 13 week internship. A graduated pay schedule provides incentive to stick with the program. Throughout their internship, supervisors offer feedback and support, monitor their performance and progress. Interns will have dedicated time to focus on personal goals and professional development. This includes completion of a life skills assessment and participation in a series of workshops that cover interview skills and self-presentation, resume and cover letter writing, job and internship search skills, and college and career options counseling. They will participate in staff meetings and attend events and trainings in the broader community.\r\nQueer Youth Outreach is a distinct track within the LEAP program focused on community organizing and advocacy. Response from participants and community groups has been overwhelmingly positive and we want to see this program continue to grow and develop beyond the life of Pride Foundation seed funding. The disproportionate representation of LGBTQ youth among the homeless, and the treatment they receive is a critical social justice issue. Our current funding will cover two more paid internships for the first quarter of our next fiscal year. Funding from Social Justice Fund NW will support teams of interns for the remainder of the year.

We have created a community of mutually beneficial and enriching relationships. Many of our youth are actively involved in systems change through various methods from active protest to community outreach and education. Through PSKS, these young people can find individuals who share their values and vision of a better world.\r\nOne of our strongest allies to emerge in the past year is with Seattle First Baptist Church (SFBC) Social Justice Committee. This is a well-connected ally group, based in our neighbrohood that seeks to understand who we are and support what we do. Importantly, they require no expectations of faith or belief. They seek only to find and engage kindred spirits for social change and offer their support. \r\nSFBC has provided both cash and in-kind support to PSKS, and they are a part of an extended community with additional resources and connections that will benefit PSKS and our ability to achieve our mission. We are currently developing opportunities for new board members and volunteers. SFBC has strong ally relationships with other Baptist Churches in the community serving Black, Asian and Latino/a and Hispanic populations. Through SFBC, PSKS is working to develop relationships that further align the demographics of our leadership with those we serve.\r\nAnother example of community collaboration is Occupy CEHKC (Commission to End Homelessness of King County). For many years PSKS staff and participants have both participated and represented homeless youth as a participant in this commission. While we recognize the value of having a seat at the table we will take a stand to ensure that economic and social justice issues are addressed. \r\n",

Our staff, board, core and interns all reflect our commitment to an inclusive community, representing no less than ten different cultures, four major religions and significant representation from people with an experience of homelessness, identifying as LGBTQ and managing mental health, disabilities and addiction recovery. For the purpose of this proposal, our current case manager and Step Beyond manager both have experience with homelessness and addiction and between them represent gender, sexual and cultural diversity.\r\nThe main strength in cultural competence at PSKS comes from our anti oppressive and empowerment model. Taking harm reduction to the community level, we meet people as they are and work with them to connect with the most appropriate resources to help them thrive. PSKS values our ability to meet the needs of varied populations and provide culturally appropriate services as they arise. For example: When we had difficulty communicating with the mother of two Eritrean immigrants participating at PSKS, we reached out and connected with the Eritrean community to facilitate translation.\r\nIt is our goal to take a more active allyship role to communities of color.

    "narrative3": "API Pride is the only LGBTQ Asian and Pacific Islander-focused group in Oregon. Therefore, our impact is immense. The mainstream LGBTQ movement is often dominated by white folks and not always welcoming to our constituency, and API cultures often view LGBTQ identity as aberrant. We provide an important service by creating a safe place for LGBTQ APIs to openly be their whole selves, to meet other people with shared identities and experiences, and ultimately to break isolation, fighting racism, homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism.\r\n\r\nMultiple Asian languages do not have words for \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian\u201d and pressure to conform to gender roles, marry, and produce heirs is strong. In the article \u201cFamily and Coming Out Issues for Asian Pacific Americans\u201d the Human Rights Campaign states, \u201cFor many Asian Pacific Americans, coming out to family is an enormous challenge. Many fear rejection, disappointing their parents or being seen as sullying the family name\u201d (https://www.hrc.org/issues/3581.htm).  The obstacles that LGBTQ API people face are numerous. By promoting the visibility and just treatment of LGBTQ API peoples APIP is an essential resource to the growing API community.\r\n\r\nOur events fight racism, homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism by providing a vibrant place for us, our friends, families and allies to celebrate our whole beautiful selves. By creating safe spaces that are culturally relevant and LGBTQ focused APIP shows constituents that they don\u2019t have to pick and choose amongst their identities.  As APIP has grown over the years, our events and presence have also grown in size. Community members invest in APIP through annual and ongoing giving opportunities. This reaffirms their ownership and commitment to the future health of the group. APIP is also welcomes individuals\u2019 greater families. Bringing family to APIP\u2019s events shows them a new perspective of what being queer and API looks like. This is especially important as APIP approaches its next goal of intentional outreach to youth.  One hurdle youth often face is how to come out to their parents and talk with them about being LGBTQ. APIP is a space where parents and families of LGBTQ youth can experience the different ways that being LGBTQ and API can be celebrated.\r\n\r\nAPIP also hopes to utilize this opportunity to foster leadership development for youth. It\u2019s important to APIP that as we do intentional outreach to youth that they are also empowered to take a leadership roles both in their own lives and as part of APIP. We have done this by sending students to local and national conferences, and funding for special projects. ",

    "narrative4": "Our goal this year is to continue providing safe and supportive environments and opportunities to celebrate, educate and bring our communities together through our four major annual events. Each event is used to connect our constituency to APIP and help foster a greater sense of community among LGBTQ API. The annual Lunar New Year\u2019s Banquet is our largest event which includes a full program of cultural performances activities, food, music and raffles from local LGBTQ and/or API businesses. Over the years, the banquet has grown from low key potlucks in homes and establishments to a fully catered and budgeted event that is more publicly accessible to our communities. The banquet requires the most planning of APIP\u2019s events and help from volunteers. \r\n\r\nThe Winter Solstice and Potluck and Summer BBQ are more intimate events that bring people together and engage them in our work throughout the year including banquet planning. \r\n\r\nOur fourth endeavor is Portland Pride. Portland Pride is APIP\u2019s opportunity to celebrate with the larger LGBTQ community and bring an API presence to the festivities. With these events APIP measures its success by increased involvement from volunteers and new and existing member participation.  \r\nAPIP is looking to is looking to increase outreach through monthly events and youth outreach. In the past APIP held monthly happy hours, some of which were issue specific or planned in conjunction with another community group. These could once again continue with increased capacity and funding for the events. \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "In an effort to best serve APIP\u2019s community, we have partnered with Basic Rights Oregon and other queer people of color groups to sponsor an annual all ages queer people of color dance party. The event allows APIP to reach a greater number of people by utilizing Basic Rights Oregon\u2019s connections and resources. APIP is also able to strengthen our relationship with the state\u2019s largest LGBT policy organization and ensure that our community needs are heard and met. Because the event is an inclusive partnership with other queer people of color groups, such as Portland Latino Gay Pride and Portland Black Pride, we are able to network with each other and collaborate on future events and projects. While a dance party may seem like a purely social gathering it allows APIP and other queer people of color groups to relate on issues that cross racial lines like HIV/AIDS, immigration, access to healthcare and education, and social isolation.\r\n\r\nAPIP is a part of the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (NQAPIA), a national coalition of queer API groups. NQAPIA holds annual conferences and training which APIP attends to strengthen the skills of our leadership and network. These trainings also give our leadership the opportunity to learn about the development of national issues such as comprehensive immigration reform and bullying. While APIP does not work on direct advocacy, we do strive to create safe inclusive spaces for our community and being knowledgeable of these issues is an important step in doing that. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Many people within the LGBTQ API communities are expected to leave parts of their experiences and selves at the door when in LGBTQ spaces, API spaces and even within their families due to homophobia, transphobia and racism. In LGBTQ spaces, the focus is on LGBTQ on mainstream issues and there often isn\u2019t room for crossover issues that affect LGBTQ API individuals. In API spaces the same can be said for LGBTQ issues. We combat this by creating spaces for both and connecting to outside communities to end isolation.\r\n\r\nBeing part of a social group can feel like a luxury if you don\u2019t have access to disposable income. Recognizing this all of APIP\u2019s events and gathering are advertised as being being open to all and that no one will be turned away for lack of funds.

Our recent Environmental Justice Bus Tour is an example of our work to guarantee an equal right to clean air, clean water, unpolluted soils, and a healthy community in which to live. A few of the successful results from the Bus Tour include:  1) clean up of a large hazardous waste dump by Union pacific Rail Road in an environmental justice neighborhood; 2) stopped low-income housing, a school and park from being constructed across the street from a massive biomass incinerator and chemical manufacturer on the grounds of environmental injustice; and 3) engaged the EPA to conduct a surprise inspection of a notorious chemical manufacturer plant with a history of air quality violations in a low-income neighborhood.  We also build capacity in rural communities battling pollution by helping to organize rallies, public hearings and advocacy campaigns. We conduct community-based and environmental health analyses.  Beyond Toxics has a strong track record promoting environmental protections and environmental justice through grassroots action. We serve over 700 members, but especially Latino, rural and low-income Oregonians. With our key partner, Centro LatinoAmericano (a social justice organization), we were recognized by the US EPA Environmental Justice Program for our community empowerment project in the West Eugene Industrial Corridor [2010 -2012], which helped develop new Latino leadership, and advanced environmental justice criteria for local and state policies.",

    "narrative3": "This project addresses the problem of environmental racism, and builds community power to demand fair treatment, environmental justice and healthy neighborhoods. Eugene is actually two different communities with different standards for environment and public health. The media promotes the \u201cTracktown,\u201d \u201cgreen Eugene\u201d version; however one community in the industrial corridor happens to be poorer (26% poverty), have more immigrants and people of color (19% minority), and their need for health and community safety are ignored. The root cause of these problems is the longstanding bias against low-income residents and immigrant neighborhoods from the centers of political power in Eugene. As a result, West Eugene receives little acknowledgement and resources from city and county government; regulating agencies refuse to enforce air pollution permits or stop illegal hazardous waste dumping. The West Eugene residential community is surrounded by heavy industrial facilities responsible for 99% of the air toxics in the City of Eugene. Health anomalies reported indicate that the West Eugene area has extraordinary levels of childhood asthma, more than 50% higher than the State of Oregon. In addition, we are collecting health information from the community identifying cancer clusters within neighborhoods. Over 125 Latino residents participate in our programs, and our community organizing reaches over 400. Now in our fourth year of community organizing, Beyond Toxics has built the relationships to tackle the root causes of environmental racism for this community with these strategies: 1. Supporting community leadership and decision making, including in our organization; 2. Bringing decision-makers directly to the impacted community to call upon them for a firm, public commitment to change a neglected community; 3. Helping West Eugene residents get appointed to key city committees that make recommendations about policies and funding;  4. Sharing resources and messaging to build the power of the community\u2019s demand for community gardens, sidewalks and paving, improved bus routes, and health clinics (these are neglected services in West Eugene); 5. Meeting with and coordinating our actions with minority community leaders representing the neighborhoods; 6. Working with a pro-bono Portland law firm on behalf of low-income and Latino residents to file a legal challenge to violations of air permits by the worst industrial polluters; 7. Carrying out environmental health research that convinced federal agencies to address the problem of unhealthy neighborhood air and contaminated soils; 8.  Empowering the community to build infrastructure for community wellness and local food security.    ",

    "narrative4": "Based on four years of focus groups, community meetings and surveys, community representatives in the Madres para la Salud, Active Bethel Residents and West Eugene Community Action projects concluded that a top priority is promoting community health by linking community gardening with local food security.  This is an important equity issue because none of the six City of Eugene community gardens are in West Eugene, yet this area is identified as a food desert and a community with higher rates of obesity.  One of the barriers to community gardening is the likelihood that neighborhood soils may be unsafe for growing food because of contamination from industrial emissions (heavy metals and solvents). Beyond Toxics is working with community organizations and community leaders on goals and strategies to address the obstacles and promote local food production.  The goals of the My Garden project are to encourage community solidarity through gardening in an environmental justice community.  Our objectives are to determine if soils are safe for gardening, provide bilingual workshops in urban gardening, create the opportunity for residents to provide their own source of fresh healthy food, generate opportunities for small-scale farmers\u2019 markets, reduce environmental hazards, promote physical activity, increase community connections, and attract more community activities. We will evaluate our success by the determining that at least 20 sites were tested for soil contamination and are cleared for gardening, 25 people participate in urban gardening workshops, the Bethel School District adopts a community garden program for families and we can demonstrate that community and family gardens in low-income and Latino neighborhoods are established and providing health food for families by August 2014. ", 
    "narrative5": "Beyond Toxics has a committed partnership with Centro LatinoAmericano that has been continuously strengthened and renewed since 2010. Perhaps unusual for an environmental justice group and a social justice group, we share staffing, resources, and funding.  Our joint purpose is to build meaningful community participation and support community voices for political change and social equality for Latino residents. Both organizations are equal and collaborative, and Beyond Toxics specifically brings our successful history as a grassroots, community organizer to the discussion. We raise awareness and increase knowledge about environmental health and environmental equity issues and solutions.  We also work in collaboration with PCUN, by organizing dedicated events and hosting their staff to speak on the topics of Wage Theft and Tuition Equity.  We send out PCUN\u2019s action alerts to our members, post on our social media sites and submit written and spoken testimony in support of PCUN\u2019s fairness and political power campaigns.  Our role is to be an ally and committed supporter, and assist PCUN with building public awareness and increasing social action and political support.  These relationships cross both issue and constituency boundaries and carry a clear benefit of expanding and diversifying the base of support and size of outreach.  Beyond Toxics has set the pace for other environmental groups to realize their own important role in supporting social justice issues by making environmental justice our platform in the Oregon Conservation Network, and asking partner groups to step up to their responsibilities, despite the difference in mission and programs. We are the only Oregon environmental group that brought social justice allies to our legislative work on pesticide reform this session.  It is our hope to encourage a diverse and inclusive progressive movement, and expand the role of the environmental movement in the work for equity, fairness and human rights. ", 
    "narrative6": "Beyond Toxics is vocal, visible and insistent on integrating the principles of human rights (dignity, equity and justice) in the environmental movement to achieve social change. We work to achieve a long range vision of environmental justice by fighting for a power-shift in political standards and political leadership, movement building and institutional change that places environmental justice as an inviolate principle. We are reliable allies on racial justice issues such as farm worker rights, wage theft justice, college tuition equity, and full representation in policy development, civic discussion and government. We focus our work on expanding the full spectrum of human rights and dismantling racism.  Beyond Toxics makes sure our own organization is free of injustice and inclusive of all Oregon residents, regardless of race, gender, orientation, and culture.  Our relationship with our social justice partner, Centro LatinoAmericano now has a four-year track record, and we continue to work together on environmental racism and social justice issues with energy and stability. Neither group \u201cuses\u201d the other; we have a well-known history of standing together, showing up together, consulting together, hiring together and partying together.  We have nurtured an active Latino community in West Eugene, building community strength and more capacity for activism. Two of our three staff are minority \u2013 one is a Latina, and one is multiracial Latino.  We are have shifted from being a \u201cwhite-led\u201d organization to one that is more diverse, where 25% of the board members are Latino, and Beyond Toxics is a permanent member of three Latino consortiums working for social justice in Lane County.

We use wilderness experience and challenge to create emotionally and physically safe spaces where boys and girls from different backgrounds can communicate and develop the emotional intelligence, perseverance, courage and compassion to be positive multi-cultural leaders in their communities.  We intentionally recruit a diverse mix of students with 50% of our students coming from low-income backgrounds and 40% identifying as people of color.

In 2008 only 58 students participated in a wilderness expedition with B.O.L.D.

This market driven growth speaks to a desire in young people to feel needed, to be of service, to belong, to feel valued, powerful and optimistic. With a 3:1 ratio of students to mentors on our expeditions we are able to create an emotionally and physically safe space through clear expectations, structured activities and supervised play .

    "narrative3": "This unintended consequence of current forest service regulations has resulted in the following distortions:\r\n-\tPeak 7 a non-profit coalition partner in Spokane that serves low-income Hispanic youth must drive 9 hours to the Olympic National Park because they cannot access any National Forest in Washington or Idaho.\r\n-\tThe Boise YMCA in Idaho operates a summer camp surrounded by National Forest lands. Since they cannot access backpacking trails that border the camp they must drive students out of state to Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks.\r\n-\tThe Bozeman and Billings YMCAs in MT, which jointly launched a new statewide G.O.L.D. & B.O.L.D. outdoor education program last fall cannot access National Forests that border the city limits and thus drive kids hours to National Parks. \r\n-\tSeattle YMCA must drive hundreds of low-income youth to Canada for summer mountaineering, backpacking and rock climbing camps due to the lack of access to most of the Cascade mountains.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of these issues is simple: when the regulations were written in the 1980s youth, people of color and low-income communities were not at the table.  The result was regulations that favor access to public lands for corporations, private schools and 97% of current forest service users.\r\n\r\nTogether our coalition can change this.  Piggybacking on local conferences we have been able to reach out to hundreds of different outdoor youth programs, local churches, public schools and teachers.  For example in October of last year our coalition hosted a half day summit before the Wilderness Risk Management conference in Portland OR exploring the issue after which a dozen organizations from ID, MT and OR who previously thought they were alone in their frustrations with the USFS joined our cause.  \r\n\r\nSpeaking in one voice we have been able to start a collaborative dialogue with the regional Forest Service (USFS) staff to fix this problem.  Most recently our coalition hosted a one day retreat on April 4th in Portland, OR with 30 youth programs and 30 USFS staff.  Supported by a mediator youth organizations and community members expressed their frustrations and USFS staff shared how budget cuts and forest fire costs have made the current system unworkable.  This dialogue has shown that both our coalition and the Forest Service wish to see more low-income youth and communities of color visiting our public lands but that sizable policy barriers stand in the way.\r\n\r\nMost significantly this dialogue has demonstrated the impact of collective power; that together we can get a seat at the table and re-write the rules so that all people, regardless of economic or racial status have equal access to our nation's public lands.  \r\n",

This includes follow up meetings from our April 4th summit.. \r\n-\tAdvocate for a pilot study here in the Northwest examining the potential impact of a new youth/educational classification of permit on local forests (this is the same classification used by the National Park Service with great success).\r\n\r\nUnlike many social justice projects the outcomes of our collective action is simple to measure. Do low-income youth and communities of color have more access to National Forests? How many more campouts, smores roastings and hiking trips have our coalition members been able to do in National Forests?  How many more organizations have joined our cause? How loud is our voice and are they listening?",

In our weekend programs students earn service hours for high school building hiking trails with Washington Trails Association (WTA).  Partnering with Treehouse for Kids we match their camp scholarships so foster care youth can see the Pacific Ocean for the first time on a summer expedition.  With College Access Now we offer a joint contract to young adults of color where they lead expeditions for BOLD & GOLD in the summers and serve as a college counselor during the school year\u2014in many cases with the same students.  And with IslandWood we offer a joint fellowship for young adults of color to earn their Master\u2019s in Education from UW while serving three summers as a B.O.L.D. & G.O.L.D. instructor and a year as an environmental educator on the IslandWood campus.  \r\n\r\nOur work is firmly rooted in changing the roots of poverty through youth empowerment. We focus providing young people the tools to take control of their lives and step up as leaders in their communities.  In partnership with organizations like Summer Search, the College Success Foundation and College Access Now we have seen our alumni go on to gain the college degree, the learning and the skills necessary to raise their family out of poverty and advocate for their community.\r\n\r\nThis project's work building and strengthening our coalition only furthers this work by providing equal access for all youth and providing one loud collective voice.",

On most of our trips no one \"group\" is in majority and we intentionally hire and train exceptional youth workers who match the demographics of our staff and volunteers (41% people of color\u20148% multi-lingual) to that of our students.\r\n\r\nTo intentionally have a staff that directly reflects the demographics of our students we created one and two year fellowships in youth development and education.  11 young adults of color we awarded a fellowship in partnership with AmeriCorps or the University of Washington last year.  Each fellowship recipient was an instructor on summer expeditions and a program coordinator during the school year building culturally fluent youth education programs at 6 organizations in Seattle. This summer each fellow will return for a second summer where they will mentor the next cohort of fellows.\r\n\r\nUltimately our organization works against oppression and social injustice through dialogue and the creation of emotionally and physically safe spaces.  We use masculine and feminine spaces to empower young men and young women - whatever that means to you and however you go there - to communicate across difference, to empathize with others and practice compassion and to recognize their own emotions and their link to their behavior.  Our work empower diverse staff and mentors and recruiting a mix of low-income and middle and upper income youth are two ways in which we build this safe space.",

    "narrative1": "   Enlace is an alliance of organizations in the United States and Mexico bent on organizing the working poor and broadening the base of organized low\u2010wage workers. We were established in 1998 by a group of low\u2010wage worker organizations that sought to overcome barriers to organizing. At that time, their greatest challenge was organizing workers whose employers were global corporations. Since then, we have coordinated several successful campaigns against global corporations and through those campaigns developed a methodology - the Integrated Organizing Approach (IOA). It combines internal capacity building techniques with strategic campaign\r\ndevelopment and geographically diverse mobilization to cultivate unique and effective campaigns. We have worked with groups developing advanced teamwork skills among staff and leaders to address evolving strategy, evaluation, accountability, and organizational structure and capacity. \r\n   Two examples of Enlace\u2019s campaigns and accomplishments include: the complex four\u2010year campaign of Enlace\r\nmember SEDEPAC against Sara Lee Corporation in Coahuila, Mexico which resulted in an unprecedented union\r\nneutrality agreement by Sara Lee; and the campaign against Korean corporation Pung Kook by Enlace member SINTTIM\r\nwhich resulted in the company, which had closed shop leaving workers without required severance pay, reopening\r\nbank accounts in Mexico in order to make these payments.\r\n    In 2009, we launched the Enlace Institute where we share the IOA methodology with low-wage worker organizations and their allies.\r\n    Several years ago, our membership determined that their greatest barrier to organizing had changed: immigrant detention and deportation in the United States had become the greatest obstacle to organizing low\u2010wage workers. We took the approach of following the money, which led us to the conclusion that the private prison industry\u2019s lobby (and its supporters in the financial services industry)\r\nwas a major force behind the arrest and incarceration of low\u2010wage immigrants. In May 2011 we launched the Private Prison Divestment Campaign.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "    Over the past decades organizations working for social change have faced increasing difficulties in winning campaigns. Battles for change, originally against local or national companies, became battles against transnational, global corporations. Now the financial services industry has become a major player - either through direct ownership of organizations that prey upon middle and working class communities or through their financial and political support of these organizations (example: the private prison industry). This change in ownership and in the way economic power is organized has made winning campaigns for social and economic justice increasingly difficult. While the Private Prison Divestment Campaign is focused on the private prison industry (Corrections Corporation of America - CCA, and the Geo Group), we must also challenge its supporters in the financial services industry, such as Wells Fargo, FIdelity (FMR) and Lazard. The Campaign challenges the financial services industry, both directly (through our actions against Wells Fargo, for example) and indirectly, by taking on the lobbyists shared by both industries and the politicians who support them.\r\n     At the same time, national organizations have grown substantially beyond their beginnings and find themselves having to focus on a variety of challenges they did not have to confront initially. The need for dynamic, impactful low-wage worker organizations will extend beyond the tenure of today\u2019s crop of leaders.  This fact illuminates the urgency for the field to develop the means to create cohesive leadership teams across the field of worker centers. The Peer Trainer Program and our new pilot, the Directors Charmed Circle Project, address the need for organizations with otherwise limited resources to acquire new capabilities at all levels of staff and leadership. Both are tasked with providing tools for leaders to think strategically and to realign their organizations internally to meet the challenge of their campaigns (and win campaigns against the financial services industry and its allies). In the Peer Trainer Program, participants apply dilemmas they are actually facing to planning and evaluation frameworks, leaving each session with a fully realized plan for an event, campaign or project. The Charmed Circle project is a response to the fact that successful social change movements are launched and advanced by organizations led by notable leaders who were each surrounded by a cohesive team of core leaders. Together with the top leader this team formed a charmed circle that advanced the organization in ways that insured growing impact well beyond the time and scope of all individuals involved. Over the next three years, we will develop and implement this program which will work intensively with organizations to develop this comprehensive leadership. \r\n    The Campaign and Institute complement each other - a direct action campaign and a methodology that prepares organizations to win.",

Major objective of the campaign is to build permanent alliances. The Steering Committee has designated a Movement Building subcommittee; its purpose is to recruit new partners and allies to ensure the inclusion of all organizations whose constituencies are negatively impacted by the manipulation of public policy in support of the private prison industry. Currently this sub\u2010committee is reaching out to criminal justice and African American organizations, such as The New Jim Crow, and to a broad base of immigrant-led organizations, such as the Center for Intercultural Organizing and VOZ in Portland, and El Comite Pro Reforma and Casa Latina in Seattle.\r\n3.

Some have come to the Campaign as allies, and other because their constituent populations have also been devastated by the private prison industry and its lobbying for stricter enforcement.

Through the Institute we have diversified the types of organizations we work with, but all serve low-wage worker communities.

They both are bent on changing the system where so much power lies in the financial sector.

    "narrative3": "The proposed project will support Project Q, a Youth and Young Adult led group under API Chaya\u2019s Queer Network Program. Project Q addresses the silencing of violence towards people of color in the LGBTQ community, including domestic and sexual violence, bullying, hate crimes, etc. We believe that the root causes of these issues are due to stereotyping, homophobia, gender binary expectations, sexism, racism and social norms. The tragic death of Danny Vega \u2013 a community member believed to have been targeted because he was openly gay and beaten into a coma by a trio of teens \u2013 brought fear to many. Often, crimes against LGBTQ people of color go unreported because victims do not trust police to prioritize their cases and fear police because of the history of police violence against people of color.  This is just one example of how the root causes of violence specifically impact LGBTQ people of color; there are many more examples in our communities.\r\nProject Q helps create collective power to end the silence around violence in LGBTQ communities of color. Project Q is an inclusive and safe space for LGBTQ young people of color. Members discuss own personal experiences with trauma and ways they could have internalized it. The group engages in a healing process, in which they connect their experience to larger social justice issues. Following the process of consciousness raising within the group, members address the personal/political issue of gendered violence on a bigger scale by raising awareness to the community through events and presentations. \r\nCurrent youth members of Project Q are highly committed and bring significant capacity to run the group and reach organizing goals. There is a crucial opportunity to further develop the leadership of the Project Q members. The past participation of these youth has shown that the mentorship, trainings, attending conferences, having a support group and the opportunity to independently organize events has inspired leadership in these youth as well as a commitment to their community. Building on the past success of the program, we propose that the youth\u2019s leadership be supported through stipends. Incorporating a leadership program that provides stipends for Project Q members has the potential to support the groups\u2019 expansion through a youth-led initiative. \r\nThe project addresses root causes of gendered violence from many intersections. By supporting the activism and leadership of LGBTQ youth of color we are upsetting the strongholds of ageism, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia. Inspiring activism in youth and young adults is absolutely essential for the success of the progressive social movement at large. They are the future leaders and are the best people to engage other youth to join the movement.\r\n",

By centering these experiences, Project Q actively seeks out models that don\u2019t replicate the white supremacy, ageism, patriarchy and classism that we see too often in our communities (including in activist communities).

    "narrative1": "Founded by Portland\u2010area immigrants and refugees, the Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO) was originally established to combat widespread anti\u2010Muslim sentiment after 9/11. On September 8, 2002, authorities arrested a well\u2010known Portland Imam at the airport falsely claiming his brother\u2019s luggage contained traces of TNT. CIO\u2019s founders organized a multicultural march and protest outside the federal building in Portland, attended by local Muslims and other activists.\r\n\r\nSince then, we have continued organizing against the targeting of Muslims, while broadening our focus toward building power in immigrant and refugee communities through education, civic engagement, organizing and mobilization, and intergenerational leadership development.\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, CIO has engaged thousands of individuals from diverse cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, trained new immigrant and refugee community leaders, produced hundreds of educational events, mobilized countless immigrant and refugee community members to resist public policy attacks against them, and continued to respond to individual incidents of discrimination and harassment in our community as they arise. Recent major accomplishments include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 CIO successfully worked with Oregon legislators to draft an anti\u2010profiling bill currently in the 2013 Oregon State Legislature, which includes a ban on police profiling based on gender identity and sexual orientation in addition to race, ethnicity, religion and housing status.\r\n\u2022 Co\u2010Hosted the national Rights Working Group membership meeting with One America held in Seattle, Washington (November 2012). Over 175 Rights Working Group members and allies joined in discussions and strategy sessions on human rights issues\r\n\u2022 In coalition with U.S.-born communities of color, immigrant and refugee organizations, and LGBT rights organizations, CIO helped win passage of the Safe Schools for All Youth Act in the 2009 Oregon legislative session, giving staff the tools to set clear expectations and hold students accountable for bullying and harassment.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The root causes of many issues experienced by immigrants, refugees and people of color\u2014particularly those that are LGBTQ\u2014are racism, sexism, and heterosexism, all of which play out in the public policy arena. For example, the recent immigration reform bill developed by the \u201cGang of 8\u201d US Senators does nothing to rectify the significant disparities experienced by LGBTQ immigrants; as we know, obtaining a partnership visa for a spouse or partner of the same sex is almost impossible in the current system, and the federal government should work to include ALL of our families, not just a few. Likewise, mainstream LGBTQ organizations often fail to address the needs of queer immigrants and refugees or provide spaces for them to explore their shared experiences as newcomers to the United States and the social and cultural isolation they can experience in their own ethnic communities, including cultural and familial excommunication (double isolation).\r\n\r\nGrounded in the belief that organizing people who are suffering oppression has the greatest potential to affect the root causes of economic, political and social injustice, CIO involves our immigrant and refugee members in all aspects of program development and implementation. Through CIO, immigrants and refugees from diverse backgrounds develop a unified voice, advocate for their rights, and create an environment in which they are recognized and supported as valued community members.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Intercultural Organizing integrates four critical areas that, when combined, catalyze systemic change:\r\n\u2022 Community Education\u2014The Center educates immigrants, refugees and U.S.\u2010born allies on pressing community issues and strengthens and supports existing efforts to bring visibility to immigrant and refugee struggles.\r\n\u2022 Civic Engagement and Policy Advocacy\u2014Our civic engagement program provides a pathway for immigrants and refugees to participate in democratic processes through training programs, hands\u2010on projects and collective action that produce concrete improvements in their lives through policy change.\r\n\u2022 Organizing and Mobilization\u2014CIO assists immigrant and refugee community members in building the organizing skills necessary to impact policies that affect them and to work collaboratively, mobilizing diverse constituencies.\r\n\u2022 Intergenerational Leadership Development\u2014CIO develops new leaders through a signature yearlong leadership development program as well as through on\u2010the\u2010ground leadership positions within our campaigns.\r\n",

Over the past year, CIO has heard from many LGBTQ immigrants and refugees (some out, some not), who know that our organization is progressive and supportive of their rights. They have asked CIO to assist them develop a space where they can meet, support one another, and organize. This proposal (and a sister-proposal for training submitted to Western States Center) will help CIO build the tools, analysis and ability to engage LGBTQ immigrants, refugees and people of color and build the power necessary to take action on their issues of concern.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve months of the Social Justice Fund grant, CIO will:\r\n - Hire a LGBTQ project coordinator\r\n - Staff a twice-monthly support/leadership group of LGBTQ immigrants, refugees, and people of color\r\n - Reserve four \"Friday Forum\" and/or other membership events for issues of concern to LGTBQ members\r\n - Develop and conduct a culturally relevant needs assessment for LGBTQ newcomers\r\n - Plan and begin implementing issue campaign(s) and needed partnerships the further the rights of immigrant and refugee LGBTQ community members\r\n - Build CIO's base of LGBTQ-identified immigrants, refugees and people of color to 50\r\n\r\nNote: CIO also intends to send staff and Board members to quarterly Western States Center training convenings (50-100 hours training) and initiate a \"Train-the-Trainer\" program inside CIO so that the Western States Center Uniting Communities curriculum is implemented inside our currently existing leadership programs. Training activities are not outlined in the timeline form below as they are subject to acceptance into Western States Center's Uniting Communities project. Should CIO not be accepted, we will find appropriate trainers to meet this need.", 
    "narrative5": "CIO\u2019s collaborations are both local and national. At the federal level, we are an active, dues\u2010paying member of the Alliance for a Just Society (formerly Northwest Federation of Community Organizations) and an organizational member of Rights Working Group. These two national coalitions enable CIO to be at the table and bring our multi\u2010ethnic perspective to human rights issue campaign efforts. In Oregon, CIO builds capacity for seven immigrant and refugee led organizations through our Capacity for Associations of Newcomers (CAN) Project.\r\nc\r\nCIO sees our role in the immigrant rights movement as building a shared analysis of immigrant and refugee issues and fostering solidarity across identities, culture and race. Working closely with coalitions, such as the progressive alliance of people of color/queer/immigrant rights organizations that joined us in Salem in 2013\u2014and organizations with similar missions like APANO, Urban League of Portland, and CAUSA, creates the space necessary to build these connections. In the past year, CIO worked with nearly 60 organizations. On some issue campaigns\u2014such as introducing an anti\u2010profiling bill in the state legislature\u2014CIO was the lead organization and on other issues, such as tuition equity, we are a partner group.\r\n\r\nWe envision a strong multilingual, multicultural progressive movement inclusive of all. In order to build such a movement, we must first recognize the dynamics that make collaborative work challenging for diverse immigrant and refugee communities. Our programs\u2014both internal and external\u2014offer a safe space for cross\u2010cultural dialogue, analysis, strategy building and organizing that foster long\u2010term alliances between communities. We believe this groundwork is essential to creating solidarity among peoples and the building power necessary for social change. A strong, cross\u2010cultural immigrant and refugee rights movement will then able to link with other social justice movements and withstand potential wedge issues between them.", 
    "narrative6": "Because much of our organizing is framed through a racial justice lens, first generation immigrants and refugees\u2014particularly those who come from communities of color such as African, Asian/Pacific Islander, Latino, and Arab\u2014are the primary constituency of our organization and the focus of our work. However, the Center also understands the need for multiethnic coalition building; thus, Slavic and other white immigrants are also considered as part of our constituency.\r\n\r\nIssues faced by immigrants and refugees include racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism and ableism: from the U.S. citizen who is blocked from bringing a same\u2010sex partner to the disparate treatment of poor workers to the trafficking of women as sex slaves. These issues are addressed within our organization as well as within the curriculum we teach during our programs. For example, workshops designed for the Pan\u2010Immigrant Leadership and Organizing Training (PILOT) Program, a yearlong leadership development series for first\u2010generation immigrants and refugees, directly address racism, homophobia, gender oppression and sexism in an intensive, multicultural group context. When recruiting for this program, we specifically select individuals who represent the broad spectrum of the immigrant/refugee experience, including participants experiencing multiple oppressions (e.g., immigrants with disabilities, queer immigrants, etc.).\r\n\r\nWe have likewise developed very explicit roles for Constituent Members (first generation immigrants and refugees) and Ally Members (U.S.\u2010born people of all ethnic backgrounds) within our membership structure. This enables those with a direct experience of immigration to lead campaigns, hold Board positions and run committees while ensuring a meaningful support role for allies. We are also building more connections between U.S.\u2010born communities of color, such as Native Americans, African Americans and other ethnic communities through our issue campaigns and organizing trainings, a move that will not only open immigrants and refugees to the experiences of other oppressed groups, but also ensure greater power to eliminate injustice.",

We continue to be a grassroots, membership-based organization with over 1,800 members and seven local affiliate groups.  Our mission is to promote democratic values and principles, such as pluralism, equality and justice; to challenge bigotry and intolerance; and to organize communities to speak out in support of human rights principles and democratic institutions.  \r\nFrom the beginning, we have advocated for LGBT rights and inclusion in our states public policies and our communities.  For over two decades we have worked to contribute to a safe and inclusive state.  We joined successful litigation efforts to repeal Montana's \"sodomy laws\" which were ruled unconstitutional in 1997 and to secure benefits for same-sex partners working for Montana universities.  During the 2013 Montana Legislature we were finally able to remove the unconstitutional \"diviate sexual conduct\" law from our state statutes.  Over the years we have led a coalition of LGBT supportive organizations in legislative advocacy efforts, engaged Montanans in grassroots advocacy efforts, created the documentary \"The End of Silence: Montana Gay Youth Speak\" to address bullying in schools, co-sponsored Pride celebrations, responded to bias-based crimes against members of the LGBT community, and held various issue education events to raise awareness on LGBT rights issues.\r\nIn 2009, we made a strategic decision to begin an effort to pass local non-discrimination ordinances that protect the LGBT community.  In 2010 we ran our first successful campaign in Missoula, identifying over 2,500 new supporters of LGBT inclusion and passing an ordinance.  In 2012 we replicated a similar but distinct campaign in Helena, passing an ordinance and identifying over 3,000 supporters.  These efforts to build-base, train supporters on skills and a shared analysis, and pass policies are now central to our LGBT issue work.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "LGBT Montanans do not have basic legal protections that allow individuals to ensure safety and dignity for themselves and their families.  The absence of these protections result in marginalization of community members and clear inequity in both opportunities and outcomes.    We understand that the root causes of marginalization and inequity are complex and involve institutional and societal sexism, racism, heterosexism, and gender injustice.  A critical component of our local organizing efforts is developing a shared intersectional analysis that centers an understanding of how our communities are connected and how we deal with marginalization and oppression collectively.  \r\nWhile working on local organizing campaigns, it has become clear that in a rural state like Montana it is as important to address problems of isolation and fear, as it is to pass local protections and identify supporters.  As we began our work in Helena, we heard over and over again from community members that they didn't know each other, there weren't safe spaces or easy ways to meet each other, and that isolation and feeling unsafe were having negative consequences on community members.  While this may seem obvious, the level to which it was coming up in our preliminary work in Helena was jarring.  We were given clear direction by the community, that a campaign to identify supporters, build-base, and pass a local ordinance was important.  But equally important for the LGBT community was building a sense of community and creating safe spaces for the community to gather and get to know each other.   As a result of this, we changed our campaign plan in Helena to incorporate community building opportunities throughout the effort.  After we evaluated our Helena campaign, it became clear that adding this goal for the campaign enriched our work in Helena and has significantly affected the way we think about building power as we continue local organizing efforts.  Our core values and strategies around building collective power: centering the communities most affected, building a shared intersectional analysis, developing leadership, and sharing power have not changed.  However, after executing and evaluating the community building components of our Helena campaign, we have recognized how vital identifying, creating and maintaining safe spaces for community members are toward our efforts to build power and change power relations.  Helena was a lengthy and difficult campaign.  We passed an ordinance and built a base of support that we were able to transfer into a tough legislative session where we achieved our first LGBT legislative victories.  These outcomes were the result of maintaining positive energy, camaraderie, and community support throughout the Helena campaign.  We believe that we could not have achieved this without the integration of community building activities during the campaign.   ",

Our central strategy toward this goal is to continue to work on concentrated  local campaigns that identify supporters, build a shared intersectional analysis, and develop new leadership from within the community. Our objectives for the coming year are to pass an inclusive non-discrimination ordinance in Bozeman, begin significant work toward an ordinance in Billings, and to maintain the engagement and energy around LGBT work in Helena.  We are committed to maintaining energy and engagement from the Helena community as we take on new and expanded challenges elsewhere.  Without a local campaign or a legislative session, this will take designated resources and thoughtfulness.  The funding we are requesting from the LGBTQ Giving Project will be designated to maintaining the energy, community, and collective power that we have built in Helena, and ensuring that the community building strategies that worked so well during the Helena campaign are fully incorporated into our efforts in Bozeman and Billings.  To maintain what we have built in Helena, we will create and support a local community building team in Helena.  The members of this team will be individuals who took on significant leadership roles during the Helena campaign.  The team will include steering committee members as well as members of the community who became leaders during the campaign.  Our  work will be assessed through formal and informal evaluation by staff, steering committee, volunteers, and participants.  We have numeric ranges for various objectives (IDed supporters, participants, volunteer hours, etc.) but we also engage in more qualitative  assessments that focus on general feedback from the community at large and those who are involved in our efforts.", 
    "narrative5": "MHRN participates in a number of coalitions and partnerships because we value collaboration and these activities allow us to work with various constituencies outside of our membership base and across issues.  The Montana Reproductive Rights Coalition is comprised of a number of statewide organizations working to ensure that Montanans have equitable access to a comprehensive range of reproductive healthcare and information on reproductive healthcare.  We collaborate to work on a variety of public policy issues in this coalition.  Our work involves community education, mobilization and policy advocacy.   MHRN's role in this coalition is to bring a reproductive justice framework to the table.  Our work in this coalition allows us to deepen alliances with other organizations, share our analysis, and communicate with our membership in a timely way on policies that affect reproductive justice.  \r\nSince 2007, MHRN has convened an informal alliance of organizations and individuals who are committed to immigrant rights.  This partnership has worked together to leverage limited resources in order to engage in issue education, respond to anti-immigrant policies, and organize collaboratively to build a base of support for immigration policies that align with human rights values.  This partnership has seen great success over the years in defeating anti-immigrant legislation, and has also dealt with significant defeat at the ballot.  MHRN is convening the group again this spring to develop a clear plan to support comprehensive immigration reform in the state.\r\nWe believe that both of these collaborations are reflective of our work to organize across issues and constituencies and develop a base of support for just public policy.  We are committed to bringing an intersectional analysis and human rights values to all of our collaborations, looking for opportunities to share our analysis with other membership organizations, and doing accountability work with organizations when it is necessary.  ", 
    "narrative6": "MHRN uses an intersectional, movement-building framework that centers human rights values in our program work.  We understand that an intersectional and multi-oppression analysis is critical to building a movement for social justice and promoting diverse, safe, and functional communities around Montana.  For that reason, our analysis requires us to examine how communities of color, low-income communities, and other marginalized communities can be disproportionally impacted by public policy and campaigns.  We also understand that organizations can do real harm to communities if they are not thoughtful about who wins and who loses in terms of messages and strategies.  We use common racial justice tools to evaluate both policies that we work on and our message and strategy regarding those policies.  \r\nWhile we are a primary white organization and play an ally role on racial justice issues, we believe it is critical as a progressive organization to have a clear racial justice analysis.  We're continually working to make sure the leadership of our organization reflects the diversity of Montana, and we continue to offer trainings and educational opportunities on racial justice to people at all levels of our organization.  Our work on the issue of immigration has provided opportunities for expanding the racial justice analysis of our base.  We are currently working with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in an effort to combat anti-Indian organizing that has started around the Bison range and a water compact.  Last election cycle we worked to organize a reproductive justice training for staff and leaders of organizational members of the reproductive rights coalition.  MHRN offers opportunities for our members and allies to participate in trainings that build an intersectional, multi-oppression analysis.  We use curriculum developed by the Western States Center to draw out intersections between communities and showcase the necessity of centering marginalized communities, naming and framing race proactively, and engaging in accountability work as an ally when it is necessary.

    "narrative3": "The Urban League addresses inequities faced by communities of color in Oregon in a variety of ways.  We feel the root causes of these problems are complex, which is why we take such a multifaceted approach in our service to the community.  Clearly a main contributor to the injustice faced by African Americans in the Pacific Northwest is a historical policy of institutional racism and oppression that has had a lasting effect on much of the community.  These historical policies have built barriers to prosperity, and generational poverty that has been difficult for many to overcome. One of our main areas of focus, which is a direct response to oppressive and exclusionary policies, is our civic engagement program.  \r\n\r\nWe conduct Social Justice and Civic Leadership Training programs. Previous graduates of these programs have had a great impact on the community: they've earned seats on directorial boards, commissions and advisory committees to City of Portland bureaus and departments. The training programs educated about the role of government, and what it means to be a community leader. The goals of these training programs are to increase levels of civic engagement and help shape local policy to result in improved outcomes in jobs, housing, education and healthcare for the under-served communities in the region.  These graduates know how to intervene and advocate  more effectively in interactions with the child welfare system, the education system, housing, law enforcement and the criminal justice system, and also how to better navigate the healthcare system to promote physical and mental health, wellness and ensure preventative and culturally competent care.\r\n\r\nOverall, through our civic engagement program, the activities are aimed at helping African Americans and other underrepresented community members become effective leaders. Our goal is to expand and extend this role to address the growing communities of color in East Portland. We have a dedicated and committed organizer who will work in this area, and further opportunities for meeting, community gatherings, forums, voter engagement, door to door canvasses and other tools for building community participation. We feel the best way to build collective power is to organize and to get involved and we are very proud of our track record and commitment to these principles.  \r\n\r\nAnother main area of focus that we feel addresses economic injustice is to focus on health equity-- African Americans do not receive the same quality of care as White Oregonians and this directly impacts their abilities to achieve economic parity.  To address health equity, a root cause of economic injustice, we work with a number of local coalitions to implement new culturally competent health policies, community health worker programs, and advice on the Oregon Health Policy initiative. \r\n",

This year, we plan to continue our work in moving our geographic area of focus both South and East, by attempting to reconnect with black Portlanders who have been displaced.  We plan  to build a visual and vocal voice of African Americans in city, county and state politics through voter registration, education and strategic engagement, notably our East Portland Social Justice and Civic Leadership Training. Develop door to door canvass in SE Portland, register 500 African American voters and recruit and train a base of 25 leaders and activists through leadership development. Because they deal with countable achievements, these goals are easily measured, and we have met our registration and leadership development objects for three years in a row.\r\n\r\nAnother major focus of our next fiscal year's workplan is establishing a culturally competent, ethnically diverse, African American and African Community health worker program, positioning Urban League of Portland, in collaboration with key community partners, to develop a professional training and best practice network for Black CHWs who can be meaningfully, structurally, integrated into clinical and community professional health roles. This goal will be measured by building the infrastructure needed to track outcomes associated with CHWs; central to this goal is the development of a CHW electronic medical record keeping system that is user friendly, secure and cost effective. Our goal is to implement a strong evaluation and data driven training program model. In partnership with Morehouse School of Medicine, the National Urban League has developed a CHW training and support model to promote healthy lifestyles and deliver services to African American adults. The holistic approach employed by Urban League trained CHWs supports clients in addressing a broad range health factors, including, economic, social and psychosocial issues.\r\n",

With over 40,000 members, our organization\u2019s power comes from people taking action together for justice.\r\n\r\nWith an emphasis on structural and institutional change, our organization addresses the root causes of racial and economic injustice by organizing, leadership development, strategic campaigns and policy advocacy. Washington CAN! is fighting for health equity, economic justice, and immigrant rights by ensuring that people of color and low-income families are leading campaigns that improve their lives.\r\n\r\nWashington CAN! was established in the 1970s out of the struggle to prevent utility companies from shutting off electricity for low-income families. Over the past decade, we have fought to pass the highest minimum wage in the country, create the Washington State Prescription Drug Program to help low-income people afford prescriptions, improve language services and culturally competent care at local hospitals, and create a local task force to address the relationship between law enforcement, city officials, and immigrant residents.\r\n\r\nOur more recent accomplishments include:\r\n\r\n- Playing a lead role in the historic passage of national health care reform and fighting to ensure that in implementation the law lives up to its promise of affordable health care for all;\r\n\r\n- Closing the Wall Street bank tax loophole in Washington State, and protecting funding for critical public programs;\r\n\r\n- Registering nearly 100,000 voters in the past decade, including 11,232 low-income people and young adults before the 2012 election.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a grassroots organization, our strength depends on our members\u2019 involvement. By guaranteeing that our members voices drive our campaigns and issue priorities, we ensure that the people who are most impacted by issues of injustice have a central voice in reshaping our society.

    "narrative3": "The housing crisis caused by the Wall Street banks has had a devastating impact on communities of color and working and middle class homeowners. In Seattle alone, over 16,500 families have already lost their homes. For most families, this means a loss of their ability to save for college, retirement or a health care crisis.\r\n\r\nThe crisis has disproportionately impacted communities of color. Wall Street\u2019s discriminatory lending practices intentionally targeted people of color for subprime loans, inflating the housing bubble and ultimately robbing those homeowners of their savings and assets. For many families of color, most if not all of their wealth resided in their home. Since the housing crisis began, median wealth fell by 66% among Latino households and 53% among African American households. \r\n\r\nAnd the crisis is far from over. More than 42,000 Seattle homeowners are underwater in their mortgages, and thus are still at risk of foreclosure.  Foreclosure prevention programs have failed to help these homeowners because they have not forced lenders to renegotiate mortgages in ways that restore wealth. \r\n\r\nTo truly end the foreclosure crisis, it is necessary to reset mortgages to fair market value by writing down the principal and interest rate on underwater loans. Without a powerful campaign led by homeowners and affected communities themselves, the big banks will remain unwilling to negotiate in ways that help homeowners in the long term. \r\n\r\nWriting down principal on underwater loans will redress the wrongs of predatory banking practices, bring needed economic stimulus to Seattle, and keep families in their homes. On average, underwater homeowners would save $771 each month on their mortgages, allowing families to either save money, or stimulate our local economy. This solution, which would be the first of its kind in the nation, would change the national conversation about bank accountability and increase the power of homeowners across the country. \r\n\r\nOur campaign, which is led by those most impacted by the crisis, is calling on the banks and the City of Seattle to take bold action to keep families in their homes. Our organizing strategy starts with engaging homeowners directly impacted by the crisis, and partnering with pastors from the African American community whose congregations have been suffering the most. A strong coalition of homeowners and faith, community and labor allies will build the collective power necessary to counter the big banks and restore wealth that has been taken from our communities. \r\n\r\n",

Recruitment of individuals impacted by the crisis will ensure their voices lead the campaign. We will focus on communities of color and homeowners who are underwater or facing foreclosure.\r\n\r\n- Leadership development. Through home visits, membership meetings, trainings and public speaking opportunities, we will develop a base of 150 grassroots leaders impacted by the crisis.\r\n\r\n- Leading with race. The foreclosure crisis has most directly impacted people of color. We will highlight the racially discriminatory practices of the banks and ensure that people of color are leading the fight to restore community wealth. \r\n\r\n- Building a diverse and powerful coalition. We will work with a network of African American churches, engage other faith leaders, and partner with allies in community and labor organizations. \r\n\r\n- Issue education. We will plan mobilizations and community meetings to raise awareness of the foreclosure crisis and popularize the concept of principal write-down as a solution.\r\n\r\n- Media and communications. The campaign will implement a communications plan that includes earned media, social media, and mobilization of opinion leaders who communicate to broad\\constituencies.  \r\n\r\n- Bolstering potential champions. Educating key stakeholders, sharing stories, lifting up the benefits of principal reduction, and grassroots mobilization will provide decisionmakers with the information and community support they need to implement principal reduction.\r\n\r\nThe success of our campaign will be measured both by our advancement towards our policy goal and by progress towards key benchmarks (i.e. leaders developed, community meetings, stories collected, calls to action generated, earned media, etc.) that are listed in the chart below.", 
    "narrative5": "Washington CAN! believes that building coalitions is an essential strategy to achieving social change. We play leadership roles in a range of coalitions on issues of health care access (Healthy Washington Coalition), economic justice (Our Economic Future coalition, Racial Equity Team, Americans for Tax Fairness), racial justice (Facing Race coalition, Race and Social Justice Initiative) and immigrant rights (Fair Immigration Reform Movement, Caring Across Generations, Immigration Roundtable). \r\n\r\nWashington CAN! convenes the Facing Race network, a coalition of over 50 organizations working together to achieve racial justice through public policy. This coalition produces the annual \u201cFacing Race\u201d report, which analyzes the impact of state-level budget and policy decisions on communities of color. The purpose of the coalition is to create a unified voice on issues of racial equity, and ensure that communities are not pitted against each other in budget decisions. The coalition also works together to create a proactive policy agenda to advance racial equity. Rachael DeCruz, Washington CAN!'s Communications Director, chairs the coalition, which is also supported by Mauricio Ay\u00f3n, Washington CAN!'s Policy Director, and other staff. Washington CAN! is also principally responsible for researching and producing the \"Facing Race\" report. \r\n\r\nWe are applying the same principles of coalition building to our campaign to stop foreclosures. Washington CAN! is creating a broad-based coalition including immigrant, faith, and labor groups. Some organizations involved include United Black Clergy, NAACP, Casa Latina, labor partners, SAFE, Central Area Chamber of Commerce, One America, and the Statewide Poverty Action Network. Washington CAN! convenes the coalition and ensures the campaign is accountable to the needs of the communities who are impacted by this issue. We need a broad and unified movement to effectively challenge power, and we can only achieve that unity if we bring diverse partners together to fight for a common goal. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Washington CAN! is an organization dedicated to advancing racial justice, and racial equity is addressed at all levels of our organization. Our organizing efforts have always been focused on low and moderate-income communities, yet for much of our organization\u2019s 35-year history, our members were primarily white. We have used this as an opportunity to educate and engage our members as allies in fights against structural inequality and racism. \r\n\r\nFor the past several years, Washington CAN! has intentionally focused organizing efforts in communities of color, and worked to develop leaders that are people of color. In conjunction with this leadership development work, we have recruited people of color as Board members and hired and retained a diverse staff team that reflects the communities where we organize. Now, over half of our core active leaders and our program staff are people of color, and our Board is growing in diversity. \r\n\r\nWashington CAN! also incorporates a racial equity lens into all of our campaigns. Our analysis of the problems with the health care system leads with racial disparities in health and barriers to health care access, and our economic justice work is focused around the disproportionate impact that budget cuts have on communities of color. Our campaign against foreclosures leads with race and the impact the crisis has had on communities of color. We also address issues of racial equity through our immigration reform work.\r\n\r\nThe annual \u201cFacing Race\u201d report - produced by Washington CAN! - is another tool we use to advance racial equity. The report analyzes the impact of policy and budget decisions on communities of color and is used to hold legislators accountable to those communities. The report provides our members and allies with a concrete tool to engage in discussions about racial equity with decisionmakers. The report is also used as an educational tool; we and many of our allies conduct workshops and trainings on racial equity based on the report findings. \r\n\r\nWe see all forms of oppression as interrelated and acknowledge that all of our struggles are interconnected. That is why for our 2013 Grassroots Action Day we partnered with LGBTQ Allyship (an organization fighting for social and economic justice led by LGBTQ people and allies), and rededicated our energy to supporting issues that affect the LGBTQ community. We also provide anti-oppression trainings to our members as part of our effort to bring people together around a common vision of justice for all. ",

Our economic justice work has focused around big bank accountability, making large corporations pay their fair share, and stopping budget cuts to critical services.  \r\n\r\nThe foreclosure crisis is yet another example of Wall Street wealth rigging the economic system to their advantage, at the expense of homeowners and our communities. Moreover, the foreclosure crisis has widened the wealth gap between people of color and white residents to an alarming degree. Before the crisis, the average white American had 10 times the wealth of the average African American; because of the loss of home assets in the African American community, this gap has now doubled. \r\n\r\nTop economists say that housing remains the single biggest impediment to economic recovery and that what\u2019s needed is principal write-down or mass mortgage refinancing. Yet no matter how many economists and leaders call for a widespread principal reduction program, Wall Street has been unwilling to take this step.  \r\n\r\nThe foreclosure crisis is increasing economic inequality and redistributing wealth away from communities of color. Organizing and mobilizing for economic justice is necessary to stop the crisis and restore community wealth. This campaign is a central component of our overarching goal of building an economy that is based values of fairness, equality and opportunity.",

Our legislative successes include:\r\n\r\n* Basic Needs:\r\nWe successfully advocated for a system to provide food assistance to Washington immigrants (1997); helped create the Apple Health program, which provides healthcare coverage for Washington children, regardless of immigration status (2008); and organized a Save Our Safety Net campaign that held the line against new cuts to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (2012).\r\n\r\n* Consumer Protections:\r\nWe were instrumental in passing: 1) more consumer protection bills than had passed in the previous two decades combined (2008), including six bills that protect consumers against predatory mortgage lenders; 2) a 2009 payday lending law that has saved Washingtonians over $137 million and may serve as a national model; and 3) the Washington Foreclosure Fairness Act (2011).

    "narrative3": "The heart of Poverty Action\u2019s work is building political power among people with low incomes and people of color who are typically left out of political processes. With large corporations pouring money into campaigns, lawmakers often feel little accountability to people who cannot make large contributions. Moreover, these same corporations spend large amounts of money to prevent people with low incomes from advocating for changes to this system. In response, Poverty Action focuses on placing our constituency as leaders in our legislative campaigns, and creating analyses that demonstrate the way that public policy can improve or worsen racial equity. Through our campaigns, we address systemic barriers\u2014including racism, sexism, and xenophobia\u2014to economic security, as well as hold corporations accountable to consumers, families, and workers in Washington. \r\n\r\nRecent budget decisions underscore the need for the legislature to hear from people with low incomes and people of color. For the past four years, legislators have chosen to cut basic health and human services significantly instead of closing corporate tax loopholes that benefit big businesses and banks. This systemic failure caused a dramatic decrease in services for people with low incomes, people with disabilities, seniors, and children. To ensure that lawmakers hear from and are accountable to low-income communities, we provide:\r\n\r\n* Grassroots Organizing and Advocacy Training: \r\nPoverty Action brings community members together to communicate with legislators through one-on-one meetings, Members in Action nights, online action alerts, phone banks, rallies, and lobby days in Olympia. We provide advocacy trainings to assist our constituents in writing to their lawmakers, crafting effective letters to the editor, testifying at hearings, and more. Advocacy trainings also ensure that we are up-to-date on the issues families and workers in Washington face and engaging people in the political progress.\r\n\r\n* Policy Advocacy: \r\nOur legislative agenda both reflects the experiences and perspectives shared in Listening Sessions, and includes an in-depth analysis of the racial equity impact of each issue. Our staff lobbyist forwards our agenda, which includes strong advocacy for basic needs programs in the state budget, consumer protections, and support for families impacted by the criminal justice system. \r\n\r\n* Leadership Development: \r\nPoverty Action has a long history of empowering activists to share their stories with the media and lawmakers through our SPEAK project. We have bolstered our longstanding leadership development efforts in low-income communities and communities of color, and are working to document and disseminate personal stories of people with low incomes from every county in our state. We work with our members to connect their personal stories to systemic issues, share their stories with their communities and the media, and connect these stories to our representatives to improve policies and programs that serve low\u2010income families and ensure corporate accountability.",

In recognition of the intersections of oppression, such as race and class, faced by our membership, we are committed to working with our constituents to address the issues they most care about through a cycle of engagement and advocacy. What begins with sharing their expertise moves to meeting with lawmakers, testifying in Olympia, registering their communities to vote, and participating as an expert in mass media. \r\n\r\nOur overarching goal for 2013-2014 is to ignite a statewide conversation on the intersections of class and race in public policy. Each of our campaigns is built to support this effort. In order to thrive, our state must embrace the fact that poverty does not exist in a vacuum and that economic justice is intrinsically linked to the struggle for racial equity.\r\n\r\nFor our policy work, we will define success as passing strong consumer protections around financial services; restoring funding, in response to deep cuts, to basic safety net services in the state budget; and connecting lawmakers to their most vulnerable constituents. We will know that lawmakers have heard and incorporated our perspectives when they use our racial impact analysis to talk about why they are supporting or opposing specific policies. \r\n\r\nWe will have been successful in building leadership when we hold at least 60 advocacy trainings throughout the state, record and share 10 stories tangibly connected to pressing issues, and bring 200 constituents to Olympia to meet with lawmakers in the coming year. Beyond the impact on legislators, we will also know our trainings are successful when community members move past the silence and shame of poverty to tell their stories about surviving on very low incomes, and proudly step forward even when they do not believe they have an important story to share.", 
    "narrative5": "1) Implementing a Strong Families Framework: Strong Families and Western States Center\r\nIn 2012, we led a coalition of smaller social justice organizations across Puget Sound to create an election season dialogue on economic justice, family preservation, juvenile justice, and reproductive rights. This cross-issue collaboration embodied our commitment to building people of color (POC) led organizational capacity through an electoral advocacy campaign that reached low-propensity voters while challenging dominant narratives about what a family looks like. Together, we created a Voter\u2019s Guide that published candidates\u2019 answers to our questions about our collective priorities. By developing a shared language and framework to hold candidates accountable during the 2012 elections, together we engaged nearly 50,000 first-time, immigrant, POC, and youth voters. Furthermore, this campaign helped our partner organizations develop the tools to run advocacy and electoral organizing campaigns, including list-building, canvassing, and phone banking. Contact: Aimee Santos-Lyons, Western States Center\r\n\r\n2) Exploring Intersections of Race and Class in Policy: Racial Equity Team\r\nFurther expanding on our commitment to developing POC-led organizations in their efforts to engage in electoral organizing, we participate in our state\u2019s Racial Equity Team, a POC-led group of community leaders, activists, and lobbyists working to promote racial equity within the legislative process. With this Team, we are developing and sharing our analysis of the ways that class and race play into policy discussions, as well as serving as a clearinghouse for POC organizations to bring this analysis and messaging to their own members. In our co-facilitation role, we\u2019re helping expand the Team and bringing more voices into policy advocacy. In addition, we bring the wrap-around service mentality of our parent organization in a multi-issue approach to moving the legislature\u2019s culture and priorities.

    "narrative6": "Poverty Action illuminates the relationship between racial and economic justice, and places poverty in a historical context. Two strategies we use are:  \r\n\r\n* Racial Impact Statements\r\nIt is no longer enough to simply say that \u201ccommunities of color are disproportionately affected\u201d by a piece of legislation if we are to deepen the discussion about the intersection of racial justice, economic justice, and public policy. Instead, we must study policy initiatives that would both negatively and positively impact communities of color and then create Racial Impact Statements (RIS) about why those initiatives would have either a worsening or mitigating effect on racial equity. For example, when framing the issues of payday lending we would discuss how a history of bank redlining left many communities of color un- or under-banked and distrusting of banks, which has brought about the aggressive targeting of communities of color by this industry. We would also include the ways in which financial institutions can and should support equity in communities of color. We anticipate creating RIS for our policy priorities with the help of our members, publishing this analysis on our website and in our materials, and working with our coalition partners to use this in their campaigns. We will also use RIS to help build the analysis of lawmakers so they can be more thoughtful and proactive about the legislation they support or oppose.\r\n\r\nJust as the policies and narratives of years past continue to have an incredible impact on low-income communities and communities of color, these communities can have an incredible impact on public policy and dominant narratives using a tool such as Racial Impact Statements. \r\n\r\n* SPEAK (Sharing Personal Experience As Knowledge): \r\nSPEAK is critical in using stories to show the current disparaging narrative of low-income people as false. It instead creates new frameworks that reflect the complexity of poverty and the systemic nature of the oppression. We know that despite their invisibility, oppressions like racism cause poverty, and that poverty perpetuates these oppressions in a well-established cycle. SPEAK interrupts that cycle through by shifting discourse of poverty from an individual frame to a systemic problem that must be addressed through policy. Moreover, by bringing forward people with low incomes as spokespeople, SPEAK changes who is qualified to speak out and be the \u201cexpert.\u201d As part of the SPEAK project, we will hold Listening Sessions across Washington where we will hear powerful stories of how budget cuts and legislative policies are impacting people\u2019s lives. Then we will publish their stories for legislators, community members, and media to connect real experiences with statewide cuts to critical services and lack of consumer protections. \r\n\r\nTogether these approaches underpin our racial and economic justice organizing.

    "cycle_question": "Our work challenges institutional authority to determine who can participate in building a foundation for their own economic survival.\r\n\r\nThe core of our work is built on expanding economic and racial equity by transforming the perceptions and narratives that frame our understanding of \u201cpeople living on a low income.\u201d Everyday our interactions with institutions, governments, and media shape our collective understanding of poverty, an understanding that creates an often morally-charged image of a person who is undeserving, lazy, or defrauding the system. By making deliberate and strategic interventions that counteract this deeply held image, we can help shape the discourse to represent the humanity, intelligence, and diligence of people struggling with poverty. Shaping the narrative is essential in securing policy victories that ensure all Washingtonian\u2019s can meet their basic needs and have opportunities to prosper. \r\n\r\nUltimately, our work results in economic justice for our constituents because our policies expand access to public benefits and housing, hold corporations accountable to communities via strong consumer protections, and involve the media in speaking to our members\u2019 lived experiences and expertise. In addition, our analysis of how policies have created and continue to create systemic poverty allows us to advocate for and educate lawmakers and the media about the impact of policies on our communities. When the legislative session is over, our voter engagement work helps keep lawmakers accountable to the people they serve and to the vision of a Washington built on shared prosperity. By taking our anti-oppression framework and applying it to statewide policy we\u2019re leading the way in creating smarter legislative interventions not only aimed at breaking disproportionate outcomes, but also focused on building economic equity in our communities.",

    "narrative3": "The current climate for LGBTQ youth in Idaho is a hostile one and no other campaign or organization exists to support LGBTQ students. According to a 2003 Idaho survey, 43% of gay youth experience verbal harassment in school and in the 2007 Idaho State Legislative session, lawmakers tried to pass a bill requiring parental consent for students to join school clubs. The proposed legislation was a direct backlash to a failed effort by North Idaho students to establish a Gay/Straight Alliance (GSA) in a notoriously conservative community. \r\n\r\nIdaho is easily one of the most conservative states in the nation and for the past two decades, the Intermountain West has been the testing ground for divisive wedge issues and anti-gay attacks from fundamentalists. In 2006, a majority of Idaho\u2019s electorate approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and the amendment is among the most sweeping and destructive in the country, precluding any civil recognition for queer couples. The number of Idaho households with same-sex couples increased 73.3 percent in the past 10 years, according to new figures from the 2010 U.S. Census. Idaho posted the nation\u2019s sixth-largest percentage increase in same-sex households. \r\n\r\nFrom our Youth Night survey results, about 2/3 of our LGBTQ youth have experienced bullying in the last year and over 80% of youth hear homophobic comments in Idaho schools. Idaho also has tremendous barriers to organizing because the state is so vast and there are stark divides between rural and urban communities. In fact, many of Idaho\u2019s school districts are considered remote rather than rural. \r\n\r\nFor authentic, community-based outreach to occur in the schools, the Coalition focuses both on youth programs and training for the cadre of teachers throughout the state. Anti-LGBTQ student harassment is a well-established challenge in Idaho\u2019s schools, but teachers tell us they have no support in their building and youth tell us that those undermining a respectful climate are often educators and administrators. Through our work, we can break this isolation and fear with practical, proactive, youth- and teacher-driven conversations and tools. By equipping them with resources, tools and support we can help them become allies to LGBTQ students in the classroom and beyond. Because we take a systemic approach, we seek to develop programing that offers students, and teachers, counselors, and administrators a transformative experience that assist them in becoming powerful advocates for ours and future generations. \r\n\r\nThrough direct outreach, the Coalition provides advocacy for students and resources and skill-based training to educators. Currently, the Coalition participates in conferences throughout the state to help publicize its mission and resources and presents to many graduate classes, educators, social workers, and others to talk about the issues facing our LGBTQ community",

    "narrative5": "This year we worked in coalition with Add the Words, a group dedicated to expanding the Idaho Human Rights Act in Idaho by expanding it to include gender identity and sexual expression. After years of failing to get a print hearing, many were disillusioned by the process. Our goal working in partnership with ATW, The ACLU of Idaho, and United Vision for Idaho was to re energize activists. By bringing young people together with people who have experienced discrimination in their workplaces, who have been terminated or evicted because of their LGBTQ status or perceived status, we were able to start bridging the gaps between generations, get youth inspired to become part of a larger community, take up issues of advocacy that may not have directly affected them yet, and open up dialog about the systemic nature of oppression, and the power of community. Equally, it allowed older generations to glean a better understanding for what many are facing in schools today, and renewed their commitments to actively engage with youth, and for policies that protect all people within the LGBTQA community.\r\n\r\nThe ACLU of Idaho negotiated a settlement with the Boise School District after an incident of teacher on student bullying, which resulted in our development of a teacher workshop that we hope to make available to all districts across the state. The training is focused on the effect that bullying has on young people and the ramifications associated with LGBTQA bullying and harassment. ", 
    "narrative6": "Though, Idaho itself is not widely diversified, we strive to include all students. Of our five person board, our youth liaison is Latina, as is a member of youth advisory board. Both hail from Canyon County, which has a large Latino population, and is disproportionately poor in comparison to much of the state. Their roles are critical in allowing us to better understand the cultural barriers within these communities and develop programs that provide students from similar backgrounds advocacy and resources that they can use within their own communities.\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Safe Schools Coalition directs resources at approximately 20,000 teachers, students and families from diverse racial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.  The student organizations that the Coalition supports are also comprised of students with diverse backgrounds, including those of varying sexual orientations, gender identities, and race / ethnicities.  The Coalition is led by the executive committee, but most activities and funds  are allocated by a volunteer steering committee that includes area high school students, educators, parents, and other community members.  Currently, the Coalition has 10-15 LGBTQ students who attend monthly steering committee meetings and 20-25 student leaders from local high school GSAs, ensuring youth programming remains relevant and authentic. The Coalition prioritizes leadership development among LGBTQ and allied youth, people of color and transgender individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Human Rights Education Center, our fiscal sponsor works to promote respect for human dignity and diversity through education and to foster individual responsibility to work for justice and peace.

The foundational leadership program is a 24-month fellowship that provides culturally based training, resources, and a community of support; to help young Native leaders create positive change in their communities. NYLA connects education to action, and was created by and for students at Tribal Colleges, which serve low-resourced, predominantly rural reservation communities. \r\n\r\nNYLA fellows, and other Native American youth, are charged with upholding the traditions of their Tribal communities for their own, and future, generations. This means preserving traditional cultures, learning and restoring fluency in Native languages, and defending a deep relationship with their lands. NYLA\u2019s young leaders are committed to reversing the dire statistics Native communities struggle with on a daily basis.  While Native communities face many severe poverty indicators, NYLA focuses on the assets and strengths of Native communities: Cultural values, meaningful traditions, and strong intergenerational relationships.\r\n\r\nNYLA\u2019s member base is intertribal representing over 30 Tribal Nations.   NYLA\u2019s young leaders are predominantly in rural communities in Washington, Montana, South Dakota, Arizona and New Mexico, and committed to staying rooted in their communities for long-term leadership and development.  NYLA is focusing expansion in the Northwest, specifically in Washington and Montana.  The NYLA Fellow network has expanded to 12 fellows in Washington and Montana, and has grown from only 2 fellows in 2010.  \r\n\r\nMembers represent diverse gender identifications and sexual orientations and are from low-income communities. NYLA fellows focus their community building on issues including Environmental Justice, Civic Engagement, Strengthening Cultural Traditions and Language, Economic Development, Youth Development and Organizing, Education, Health and Wellness, Arts and Media, Community Healing, Two-Spirit/LGBTQ Community-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The Transformative Power of Traditional Foods in Native Communities\r\nTraditional foods in Native communities are symbols at the center of ceremonial, emotional, spiritual and cultural ways of life.  For Wanapum and Yakama Tribes in Washington, traditional foods of roots, salmon, elk, deer and berries represent elements of their creation story.  Harvesting all of these foods are at the heart of keeping relationships and communities vibrant and connected.  \r\n\r\nThe colonization of Native communities in the United States included violent measures to disconnect communities from language, cultural practices and entire ways of life.  This systematic assimilation process broke apart families, disconnected communities from their traditional homelands and forced them to navigate a foreign world of imposed values and systems of governance.  \r\n\r\nWith the process of land acquisition and the reservation system came the introduction of processed foods such as white flour, sugar and lard through government commodities.  Native communities now struggle with some of the highest rates of preventable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Native nations that entered into treaty agreements with the US government were guaranteed healthcare for life.  This form of healthcare resulted in the Indian Health Service, which does not practice traditional forms of healing and mirrors the lack of preventative/holistic health care of mainstream society.\r\n\r\nMany Native communities continue to struggle to process the traumas of these changes in environmental and cultural landscapes.  Cycles of substance abuse, disempowering relationships and apathy combined with systemic barriers keep communities from practicing their full agency for self-determination.\r\n\r\nNYLA practices an assets-based approach to break through the challenges listed above.  Revitalizing cultural ways of life are central to revitalizing whole communities, and at the heart of Native communities are these traditional foods.  It is a strategic place to begin to restore ecosystems, heal communities and strengthen momentum towards community change.  \r\n\r\nLong-term impact includes:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tNYLA\u2019s network of young Native leaders have implemented successful community action plans and engaged in the well being of their local tribes and communities, with advanced leadership support available for their next steps for their own futures in education, economic advancement, and leadership. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tNYLA has helped Native youth to integrate multiple worlds. Native youth are striving to navigate their traditional values and cultures, while supporting innovation in their communities along with demands of mainstream society and the lasting impact of assimilation. NYLA believes, and has proven, that helping young people to truly integrate these demands, sets them up for long-term success. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tNYLA has built bridges and positioned Native young people as trusted leaders in their own communities, and key players in social and economic movements.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tLong-term leadership development practices and principles of self-awareness are valued as necessary to the success of the next generation of community leaders.\r\n",

This work will build in the successes of collaborative work in 2012-13 where fellows visioned and created a collective mural focusing on food sovereignty across NYLA tribal communities and a holistic health fair to engage the local Yakama community.\r\n\r\nThe NYLA Northwest retreat will be in Washington from July 25-26th, where fellows will finalize their leadership development and organizing strategy plans over the next year, map out local partners and networks, and determine collaborative campaigns.  \r\n\r\nNYLA overall short-term impact includes:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGroups of at least 10 Native young people in each 24-month fellowship cycle are trained in core culturally based leadership skills and supported to complete individual and community development action plans. NYLA creates a network for each fellow, a critical component of culturally based, collective leadership.  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tStrong and collaborative partnerships with Tribal Colleges in each participating state (SD, MT, WA) create a self-sustaining mechanism for NYLA outreach and recruitment.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tLasting mentorship relationships are fostered between NYLA fellows and Native elders, leading to intergenerational dialogue and the passing down of traditions. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tCollaborative and strategic partnerships are brokered with organizations and stakeholders in the progressive movement to better connect Native organizing and Native young people to the broader movements for social change in the United States.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Collaborations: NYLA\u2019s Growing Web of Relationships\r\nThree key  collaborations are with the Movement Strategy Center (MSC), based in Oakland, CA; the nationwide coalition, the Generational Alliance; and the regional Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians.   \r\n\r\nThe Movement Strategy Center brings a cohesive plan to strengthen emerging efforts that build the progressive social justice movement by supporting individuals, organizations, alliances and sectors to be more strategic, collaborative and sustainable. \r\nIn 2012, NYLA became a member of the Generational Alliance (GA).  The GA is a collaboration of 20 national youth organizations building collective power for underrepresented & low-income communities. GA members work together to win real victories on policy priorities based on the Youth Agenda for our communities!  To date, NYLA has developed collaborative actions with GA members on voter engagement, labor rights and immigration reform.  See GA website for more information: www.generationalalliance.org.  \r\n\r\nNYLA's growing partnership with the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians is through the Education Committee and the Youth Committee.  NYLA fellows Johnny Buck and Katie Swan are co-chairs of the ATNI Youth Committee and will lead a new NYLA training initiative for ATNI youth (ages 12-18) in Spokane, WA in September 2013.  \r\n\r\nATNI Goals: http://www.atnitribes.org\r\nProvide forums for information exchange of matters of mutual concerns among member Tribes and constituencies.\r\nProvide processes for the development of consensus on policy on issues.\r\nProvide recommendations for legislation and government policy on behalf of ATNI and member Tribes.\r\nMonitor, collect information, analyze data, disseminate findings and develop policy positions on matters of interest to ATNI and its member Tribes.\r\nProvide technical assistance, education, and training to ATNI and its member Tribes.\r\nEstablish and maintain mutual assistance networks foster strategic alliances between ATNI,  member Tribes, beneficial organizations.\r\nProvide effective public relations, education program to non-Indian communities on behalf of ATNI and member Tribes.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Indigenous communities experience compounded forms of oppression, internally from lasting effects of colonialism and the forced assimilation process, and from broader society due to systemic barriers and active forces to undermine and challenge sovereignty rights.  NYLA intentionally chooses a holistic approach to community change, where our members focus on the many facets of undoing oppressive structures and strengthening their community capacity for sustained development.  \r\n\r\nNYLA by its very creation embodies the values of self-determination for indigenous communities.  Founding members chose to create their own space where the needs of their communities could be addressed through culturally-relevant, grassroots-driven development strategies.  Although all NYLA members are Native, there is a great diversity among Tribal cultures.  NYLA is beginning first to strengthen relationships across isolated Tribal communities through the passion and vision of young leaders.  These young leaders are supported to vision beyond short-term survival needs to help lead their communities forward.  \r\n\r\nNYLA's intergenerational approach also plays a key component in generational leadership and social change.  This approach is shared well on our NYLA website through a reflection by NYLA Co-Director Kevin Killer (Oglala Lakota/Kiowa) with NYLA Elder Advisory Council member Dr. Teresa Makuakane-Dreschsel: \r\n\r\nA major part of our strength as young leaders is our relationships with our elders.  We founded NYLA to create the space to lead and create change in our communities from our traditional values.  Our Elder Advisory Council members have all served as leaders in various movements and share the gift of their experience with us.  They share in our vision for NYLA and help us learn how to sustain our passion to improve our communities.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nOUR GREATEST SOLUTIONS ARE ALREADY WITHIN OUR CULTURES\r\nI value my time with Aunty Teresa because of her amazing perspective on using indigenous models of learning to influence systemic change in education.  Community organizing is a big piece of this equation as well as having community respect.  The challenge is how do we leverage this respect into meaningful change for our families and communities.  We also discussed the shared challenges between Native communities in Hawai\u2019i and reservations on the mainland such as unemployment, substance abuse, health care and other factors.\r\n\r\nAunty Teresa made an excellent point of Native communities solving problems with our own ideas and cultural resources to change the outcome rather than a one size fits all Alaskan Native/Native American/Native Hawaiian approach to community development. When we fall into this trap and it doesn\u2019t yield any results, usually the communities accepting the resources are blamed as the cause for a lack of \u2018successful development\u2019. However, by using our own resources and our own systems of understanding, many of the problems can begin to have sustainable solutions. ",

Each tribal community navigates environmental justice issues in different contexts.  One of NYLA\u2019s key approaches is to build networks and connect young leaders from diverse Tribal communities as a foundation for movement building.   A common issue focus for all NYLA fellows is sovereignty of their Nations, value systems and traditional ways of life.  Food sovereignty simply defined is people's right to determine their own food systems.  \r\n\r\nThe 2012 EJGP is a powerful investment in strengthening NYLA's network building and collaboration across very distant communities.  This distance and lack of resources and capacity to travel and build deep relationships is a key barrier to increasing food sovereignty and sustained collaborative action. \r\n\r\nSome NW fellows currently involved are Paul Cline (Lummi), Winona Bearchum (Northern Cheyenne) Makai Lewis (Dine') and Noelani Villa (Kaw) through leadership in the traditional food programs and research in the devastating effects of coal mining in the NW at the Northwest Indian College; Katie Swan (Yakama) through research impact of climate change on the future of traditional foods; Mariana Harvey (Yakama/Cowlitz) through leadership on traditional forms of healing and sustainability; Johnny Buck (Yakama/Wanapum) through leadership to revitalize active lifestyles through harvesting and further integrating traditional foods into ceremonial life; Amy Stiffarm (Cree/Blackfeet/Whiteclay) through leadership to restoring health through traditional foods and integrating into healthcare systems in Native communities; Burdette Birdinground (Apsaalooke) through his leadership to increase herds of buffalo and restore ecosystems; Kaden Walksnice (Northern Cheyenne) through his leadership to stop coal mining on his reservation.",

We define environmental justice as the presence of equitable access to environmental health, safety and beauty.  We achieve environmental justice through community organizing, advocacy, outreach and education.\r\n\r\nCCEJ has a proven track record of successfully eliminating major sources of pollution in low income communities of color.  Highlights of our work include:\r\n\r\n1) CCEJ's \"Stop the Burning\" Campaign, resulted in influencing the Veteran's Administration located in Seattle's low income blue collar highly diverse Beacon Hill neighborhood to stop burning medical waste.  Through intense door-to-door outreach, education and organizing, local residents voiced their concerns through letters and meetings with regulatory agencies and policy makers.  The campaign led to the hospital's decision to utilize a safer method of medical waste disposal.  \r\n\r\n2) CCEJ and South park residents organized to stop toxic paint fume emission from Long  Painting Company.  For more than 20 years, Long Painting operated near residential homes, creating serious noise, traffic and pollution problems.  By organizing, we packed public hearings with residents and pressured the regulatory agencies to force Long Painting to abate these problems.  The efforts paid off when the City's Zoning Board refused its expansion permit and later moved to an industrial zone.   \r\n\r\n3) Currently, CCEJ is involved in food desert issues at South Park and in leading the organizing against the coal trains in Seattle Chinatown International District by mobilizing health, civil rights, historic preservation and environmental agencies to ask EPA to included these said concerns in the EIS.

    "narrative3": "CCEJ has led and partnered in addressing organizing to address environmental justice issues. We observed that the partnerships are only tactical as opposed to long term strategic collaboration, particularly when jobs are involved.  For example, in Hope 6 federal grant that redeveloping New Holly displaced low income and people of color community members, did not fully replace, nor increase low income house stock and divided the community with sectors wanting the jobs more than wanting environmental justice. Our assessment is that the root cause of these issues is a lack of common understanding of environmental justice and the lack of intentional points of unity agreements.  CCEJ wants to address these gaps by starting with conscious education of sector partners and potential partners to build the platform for collective power.  In addition, we intend to have bimonthly EJ Network gatherings to exchange organizing information, learn about specific topical issues, and soften the ground for collaboration.  Too many organizations want to deepen their understanding of EJ and its policy, programmatic and organizing implications.  By creating  the educational and conversational forum, we can address the root causes and underlying power dynamics that prevent us from fully engaging as long term collaborators.  \r\n\r\nWe will be focusing on 6 sectors to soften the ground for effective long term collaboration:\r\n\r\nPeople of Color Community\r\n1.  Got Green - environmental and economic justice grass roots organization located and working in South Seattle.  (Status: Completed outreach.  They have agreed to participate in our program.)\r\n2.

Civil Rights Organizations e.g. Asian Pacific Americans for Civic Engagement, Filipino American Political Action Group of WA, Organization of Chinese Americans, Japanese American Citizens League.  (Status:  Successfully partnered on anti-coal train organizing  Seattle Chinatown International District).\r\n\r\nNon-People of Color\r\n5.  Mayor and City  Council.

    "narrative6": "We believe that environmental justice is a basic human right and that no community should bear an unfair burden of environmental health hazards. We promote diversity and work to address inequality and oppression by remaining a grassroots organizing effort, which involves building community power and leadership so that those affected by environmental injustice are at the forefront of the struggle. Achieving environmental justice and mobilizing oppressed people is difficult due to a variety of factors such as: lax environmental standards and enforcement, lack of political power and influence among people of color and low income people, the difficulty in linking health problems to toxic exposure, the lack of adequate information, and the high level of stress involved with poverty.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the kinds of institutional change that we are seeking, we work through local, regional and national organizing efforts and engage the help of local ally organizations. We consider ally organizations to be environmental and economic justice groups, unions, student groups, low-wage worker organizations, youth organizations, churches, women's rights groups, and health care providers. Historically, CCEJ has also worked in broad coalition with environmental justice groups throughout the Northwest, nationally, and internationally. We continue to support those efforts and contribute as much as organizational capacity allows. We intend for our organizing to be far reaching because in the process of educating and organizing people, we educate and empower their families, neighborhoods, and communities.\r\n\r\n",

Through our environmental justice training institute, we will reduce environmental injustices by creating a long term collaboration to reduce environmental exposures for people of color and low income communities.   \r\n\r\nAlthough on the surface the project appears as an education project, it actually strengthens the underpinings of strong grassroots organizing components:\r\n1. it creates common understanding for point of unity to be publicly arrived at.\r\n2. it creates mutual accountability for partners to publicly declare their commitment to the EJ cause and commitment to struggle to bring about EJ good.\r\n3.

    "narrative3": "Low-income people are at-risk of being displaced from Portland\u2019s Cully neighborhood. Cully is a predominantly low-income, people of color neighborhood of 13,300 people located in northeast Portland. It is the most ethnically and racially diverse neighborhood in Portland. It is also one of the last close-in (west of I-205) neighborhoods in Portland that has not experienced significant public and private investment. Research indicates Cully is highly vulnerable to displacement of low-income people.\r\n\r\nLiving Cully is a combined effort by Hacienda CDC, NAYA and Verde to bring needed investments to the Cully neighborhood, like parks, affordable housing and jobs. For example, our Let Us Build Cully Park! effort is an inclusive, community-led effort to bring a much-needed park to the neighborhood (there is no developed park in Cully). This effort creates jobs, minority- and woman-owned business opportunities and ownership of the park from design to asset by community members.\r\n\r\nOur Not in Cully program is a multi-organization, multi-faceted effort to prevent displacement of low-income people from the Cully neighborhood. 6/13, we complete the design of a plan to prevent displacement. At the heart of the plan is community organizing to build power to increase incomes, empower owners/renters and empower our community to bring the assets and resources it needs to guide investment without displacement.\r\n\r\nRoot Causes. \r\nA. Low-income people and people of color do not have a multi-cultural power base from which to advocate for the jobs and investments they need in Cully.\r\n\r\nB. Low-income people and people are color are not represented by the neighborhood association, which receives much deference from city planners.\r\n\r\nC. Institutional indifference to the needs of Cully has resulted in a lack of organized investment, non-existent incorporation of low-income people and people of color into economic development, urban planning and city efforts to address disparities in wealth and access to infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBuilding Collective Power.\r\nLiving Cully partners are deeply embedded in the Cully neighborhood. We empower residents to create solutions to the problems our community by directly connecting residents to the information, resources and tools necessary to address community needs. \r\n\r\nPower Shift.\r\nCommunity organizing around the Not in Cully anti-displacement strategies creates a multi-cultural power base which results in local, state and federal decision-makers having to allocate resources to prevent displacement of low-income people in Cully. For example, the city recently adopted a resolution to create a city-community committee to anticipate and address displacement, but no action has been taken. With property values rising in Cully, accelerated action by decision-makers is essential to preventing displacement.\r\n",

We will pay honoraria to members of the committee and identify necessary training resources and pay for the training necessary to equip activists with the tools necessary for effectively leading the community in anti-displacement strategies. We will provide childcare, food and translation services, all of which are necessary for effective organizing in a low-income, people of color community.\r\n\r\nAnother key focus of the committee will be to connect with Portlanders who have experienced displacement and learn from those experiences. We will invite displaced Portlanders to share their story and pay them for their time in sharing their experience and wisdom to help our community resist displacement.\r\n\r\nThe Not in Cully anti-displacement strategies cover five areas: economic development/jobs, housing, families, community building and neighborhood businesses. Each has a set of strategies and specific activities with different organizations and agencies having primary responsibility for addressing them. For example, under economic development, we need community benefits agreements with current and prospective employers in the neighborhood. The committee gains awareness of each area, the strategies and activities under each area, identifies the implementation pathways (community organizing, policy work, etc.), identifies responsible parties/resources and prioritizes action.\r\n\r\nAssessment.\r\nWe will create milestones for committee recruitment, committee member training, committee awareness of displacement issues, engagement of city partners and plan development.", 
    "narrative5": "Verde created the Living Cully initiative (LC), a coordinated effort of HCDC, NAYA and Verde. LC maximizes the benefits of the investments and work our individual organizations are doing in the Cully neighborhood to build wealth in a low-income community. In Portland, few benefits of the sustainability accrue to communities of color and low-income people. LC reinterprets sustainability as an anti-poverty strategy by connecting people of color and low income people to the benefits of sustainability \u2013 small business opportunities, individual jobs and workforce training, youth education, environmental benefits and the livability and health benefits of green infrastructure. This is evident in all of the Living Cully Signature Projects, whether it is building Cully Park, rebuilding Villa de Clara Vista (a Hacienda affordable housing project in Cully) or Columbia Biogas (family wage jobs in a green business located in the Cully neighborhood). This is a cross-issue effort \u2013 without it, sustainability continues to produce benefits only for middle-income whites in Portland and is thus un-sustainable.\r\n\r\nVerde is part of the Coalition of Communities of Color and our executive director is the chair of the economic development subcommittee. The disparities that people of color in Multnomah County are deep and growing and our advocacy to increase economic opportunity for people of color and minority owned businesses in the growing sustainability sector is informing and advancing the Coalition\u2019s work in this area. The progressive movement around environmental sustainability continues to omit an overt analysis of class and race. Verde\u2019s work with the Coalition puts income generation and wealth building for low-income people and people of color first in discussions of sustainability. Working together, we have more impact \u2013 Verde\u2019s expertise in the green economy and the Coalition\u2019s research capacity and growing clout in decision-making circles.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Cully is the most racially diverse neighborhood in in Portland and the state of Oregon. It has a closed landfill, the lowest percentage of streets with sidewalks in Portland, no developed parks, no community center, few retail services, high un- and under-employment, 5 trailer parks, 4 strip clubs and plenty of mini markets that lack fresh food. Thanks to the hard work of Hacienda CDC, NAYA and Verde, we have a new park being built, remodeled and new affordable housing, a successful early college academy for at-risk youth, among many other community empowerment efforts and assets. Living Cully links needed investments to closing the green divide in Portland where low-income people and people of color are no longer marginalized and instead enjoy the benefits of investments like parks, sidewalks and employment opportunities. \r\n\r\nWhile Portland enjoys as reputation as a green, sustainable city, those benefits have not accrued to low income people and people of color in particular. The Living Cully partnership of Hacienda, NAYA and Verde in Cully seeks to empower low-income people and people of color in building power and wealth and to lack of investment which Cully residents experience every day and has profound impacts on the health and well-being of adults and children alike. When you don\u2019t have a sidewalk to walk on or direct bus service downtown or a place to play safely, your health decreases and your ability to generate wealth decreases. Living Cully simultaneously attacks the economic injustice and racial injustice of this history of disinvestment by bringing needed assets and by doing so in ways that do not lead to displacement of low-income people as the neighborhood improves.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "Low-income people and people of color have been displaced from inner Portland neighborhoods like Albina and Mississippi. They have not benefited from the public and private investment in these neighborhoods. Instead, they have moved further and further from the urban center, while their former neighborhoods have increased in value both in terms of property value and livability. No estimate has ever been prepared showing the amount of wealth that these populations have lost due to displacement. Now, we have a chance in the Cully neighborhood to create a different outcome, one where an existing population of low-income people and people of color can design, direct and create needed investments, and through partnership with public agencies, create the policy conditions necessary to prevent displacement. These outcomes build wealth in a low-income community that, without such action, would result in another story of economic injustice of low-income people and people of color experiencing investment in their neighborhood only to not be able to afford to live there anymore.  Under-investment in the Cully neighborhood is an economic injustice. While some areas of the city thrive, Cully lacks sidewalks, parks, retail services, etc. Living Cully and Not in Cully reverse this economic injustice by bringing those investments and doing it in a way that prevents displacement. Lastly, this work challenges the sustainability movement, a movement that is creating wealth for middle- and upper-income whites but not for low-income people and people of color. It demonstrates who we can create triple bottom line solutions in a low-income neighborhood.",

Our mission is to develop systems for food sovereignty and create racial and economic justice. We believe healthy food and sustainable and just food systems are our human right. HUG is working to create a neighborhood-based model unique to our community, with the potential for replication across Tacoma.\r\n\r\nHUG was created in late 2009. With inspiration from Oakland\u2019s Peoples Grocery and Milwaukee\u2019s Growing Power, seasoned organizer Dean Jackson set out to create a community-based project to grow food and to examine and shift power in their neighborhood.  HUG started to formally take its shape in 2010 with our first grant from Social Justice Fund.  In 2011 we began our children's programs with Al Davies Boys & Girls Club!  By the fall of 2012 we had solidified a Leadership Team rooted in liberation and intersectional approaches to social justice. \r\n\r\nFood is universal! Its production offers engaging ways for communities to participate in civic action across the multiple identities we hold. Though managing food gardens may appear to be apolitical, urban farming is a vibrant tool that builds community.  It can shift the power that comes with controlling food supplies back into the hands of the people.  Through building local food justice systems we model the future we want to see. What started as a backyard garden project has grown into seven sites currently feeding 8 households.  We grow on a total of 10,500 square feet of land donated by home owners in the neighborhood.  As of this grant deadline, we have harvested 50 pounds of pac choi, 18 pounds of radish, and 32 bags of greens for community consumption.  \r\n\r\nHUG is proud of what we have accomplished as a mostly volunteer and very small budget organization!\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Food Sovereignty for the Win\r\nHUG sees tremendous long-term value in the development of our Urban Farm Network. There is an urgent need for poor and POC communities to organize collectively in creating our own food supply and amassing land to do so.  We can build shared power this way by both providing food and taking advantage of the organizing opportunities growing food in community offers. \r\n\r\nOn the Hilltop we are lucky to still have large residential land parcels and wide parking strips.  We work with homeowners to develop these unused portions of their property into food gardens.  This year we are excited to implement HUG Grub - an experiment in sharing the harvest using barter like structures.  \r\n\r\nHunger is the Symptom\r\nMany of us are familiar with the staggering hunger statistics.  1 in 5 households across Washington state reported they didn\u2019t have enough money to buy the food they needed in 2009.  Households with children are at almost double the rate of food insecurity than households without children.  While food charity models seek to address the issue of hunger, HUG views the hunger cirsis as one of the symptoms of economic poverty, resource hoarding, and inequitable wealth distribution.  We're working to address these root issues by building a neighborhood-based food system that is fresh, clean, economically accessible to poor folks, and sustainable in the community.\r\n\r\nNothing About Us Without Us\r\nRight now Tacoma is seeing a local food renaissance.  The community garden program has been expanded and people are talking about growing food in ways the city has not seen in current years.  In this excitement, there is a noticeable lack of a power analysis about structural oppression.  To be expected, this means that the leadership and framing remains largely vested in white, middle class culture that focuses on charity systems and upholds race and class privilege.\r\n\r\nHUG is the only food organization in Tacoma working through the lens of sovereignty and racial/economic justice.  We are the only organization working in our very conservative town to build the power of poor people and POC in the local food movement.  Our Leadership Team speaks on panels, at schools, and to church groups.  We consistently encounter entrenched food charity model thinking. Our presence always invites those in attendance to think beyond charity towards justice and sovereignty.  While it\u2019s an important strategy to be involved in the local food movement, we are also very conscious about our capacity and prioritizing efforts where change is most probable.\r\n",

HUG is creating this access!  We're deeply grateful to Social Justice Fund and the Environmental Justice Giving Project for continued support.   We'e now seeking your help in order to build the following 2013 focus areas:  \r\n\r\nSharing-based Distribution Model/Farm Readiness\r\nThis year we're testing out a new distribution model we're calling HUG Grub.  It's based in barter-like principles of sharing without the exchange of money.  Neighbors who are hosting HUG gardens receive all of the produce they can eat.  Other neighbors can pick up food at predetermined weekend hours and in return agree to share something with someone in the community.  Sharing can look like many different things, including spending time in HUG gardens, reading a story to your child, or helping your neighbor fix a leaky faucet.  While HUG is not facilitating these transactions, we'll be keeping track of what neighbors agree to share in community.  We seek to learn from this model and grow distribution methods based on what's realistic for the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe're prioritizing building infrastructure at The Farm - our 6,300 square foot land - to create income production in 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\nSustainability  \r\n1.  Organizational structure - Last year we solidified our Leadership Team and four Committees to move from Dean's organization to a community-led organization.  This year we're continuing to build leadership and have greater transparency about ways that neighbors can become involved.\r\n2.  Community Engagement - We've focused our outreach efforts in a four block area we call \"The HUG Zone\".  There are several ways we invite neighbors to get involved. (see below) \r\n3. Resource Development - A year-long effort is underway to build our private donor base, focusing on monthly donors.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Last year we began a relationship with School of the Arts Tacoma (SOTA).  This year we're working with two senior projects to grow food at The Farm for a Community Meal.  We're working with youth to teach basic food production skills and introduce them to concepts of food sovereignty. \r\n\r\nWe're continuing our work with WSU Pierce County Master Gardeners (PCMG). Our partnership affords us volunteers for community program and donated plant materials.  HUG is also quite excited about the deepening partnership Al Davies Boys and Girls Club. One BGC staff observed that our sessions provide balance to the club. We fill a niche through offering an explicitly justice based program that incorporates nature exploration, art and science, and nutrition.  HUG creates opportunities for kids to actualize the BGC \u201cKids at Hope\u201d philosophy. Al Davies has no other similar programming to HUG.  Because we\u2019re partnering with established organizations we\u2019ll see increased leveraging opportunities, structural \u201clegitimacy\u201d and decreased financial input from HUG.  For both of these relationships HUG is transparent and clear about our commitment to creating racial and economic justice. We have every expectation that as we grow, our capacity to model this will increase our impact on these organizations.\r\n\r\nNew this year, we're working with a startup barter project called Fair Tradin'.  They'll be bringing their barter event to our August Community Potlucks.  In addition, we are working together for a series of food preservation sessions.  This collaboration is newly formed, but comes from years of conversation between HUG's Director and Fair Tradin's founder, Hal Meng.  Im May we co-presented at the Community Garden Summit and were quite pleased with the holistic nature of the message we gave as a team.  The barter philosophy combined with HUG's intersectional anti-oppression lens looks to be a strong collaboration in the making.", 
    "narrative6": "Food independence models a path to social justice that the average person can relate to. Gardens provide an opportunity to transform scarcity modes of thinking to those of abundance. This is a powerful gift to bring to our neighbors. We are making social justice accessible to folks who have never heard of it (or who thinks it \"those people\").  We target our efforts for the working-class, low-income, and POC neighborhood we operate in.  Our success will be ensured by our relevancy and commitment to these communities.\r\n\r\nOur leadership team is predominantly mixed-race and people of color and half live on the Hilltop.  All have demonstrated a commitment to racial & economic justice through prior work, a willingness to learn, and the understanding that this is life-long work..  HUG is founded by an out queer, black, low-income, trans/genderqueer person with a history of social justice work in the Pacific Northwest.  This is important because of the strong conservative lens that runs through even progressive-minded community in Tacoma.  HUG does not seek to put the responsibility of drawing connections to systems of oppression on our Director.  The reality is that Dean's out and upfront style of leadership creates community openings that would not otherwise exist.\r\n\r\nThose in leadership positions must understand systemic oppression and how it manifests in daily interactions. Through this analysis, our work is guided to authentically address inequity and create positive community transformations.\r\n\r\nThough our mission is targeted and prioritizes low-income and POC neighbors, the reality is that urban agriculture disproportionately draws white, often middle class people with good intentions.  This provides a rich opportunity to do anti-racist work.  We are working to educate this community as to their positionality as white people in order to build strong allies in our organization.  \r\n\r\nSo what does this all look like in the day to day?\r\n1.\tHUG creates a space for the conversation.  At every public event we have ever spoke at (really, every event) at least one person thanks us for bringing issues of oppression into the conversation.  During our Community Work Hours we have had conversations with neighbors about HUG's philosophy and vision.  We here and see that there are folks in the community hungry for a positive space to have these conversations.\r\n2.\tThe white-identified members of the leadership team all work towards self education outside of their HUG leadership and advocacy in their social and work networks.\r\n3.\tWith each event and conversation we are building our capacity to organize\r\naround these issues in Tacoma. It\u2019s a town that has fierce pride and a strongly military and organized religion influence.  We cannot stress enough the conservative nature of the community.\r\n",

We build collective power through  partnerships  with other charity organizations, collectively engaging every community to join in solidarity as we aim to reduce recidivism. We communicate through radio, local television,  and garner support through constituents who are for creating equal opportunities and justice for all; every income level, every social class, every ethnicity, and every gender. Collective power is a special blend of ever evolving community, business, local, county, government, and constituent support, working together to serve every community.\r\n\u25cf\tHow will your work change the root causes and underlying power dynamics of the identified problems, needs or issues?- We attend several conferences, community support groups, we continually build relationships with local businesses, faith based, non-profits, community, and entrepreneurs. This way we align our beliefs together and pull resources together to help employ, encourage, educate, those with felony backgrounds. \r\n",

    "cycle_question": "We understand there are several different methods to approach economic justice, and we focus on three methods. Method one is Harmony. Unifying and standing together aligning our beliefs together with like minded institutions, and individuals who live in harmony and have a common goal of justice and equality for all persons. Being in harmony sometimes means being open minded to different views and approaches, but also staying true to integrity and keeping the vision in focus while striving for social/economic justice. Harmony is more consistent with the truism that a society that seeks peace, must first work for justice. Method number two as we see it is, understanding what justice means and how to administer it. Our definition of justice allows us to know what our work assignment is. How we define \u201d justice is a set of universal principles which guide people in judging what is right and what is wrong, no matter what culture and society they live in.  Justice is one of four cardinal values, of classical moral philosophy, along with courage, temperance, and efficiency (faith, hope & charity are in the religious faith based sector).  Virtues help individuals fully develop their human potential, while enabling them to work in harmony with others for common good. We also feel that social justice has an important role in economic justice as well. Social Justice being the third component (which there are many more) encompasses economic justice. Social Justice imposes on every one of us a personal responsibility to work with others to design and continually perfect our institutions as tools for personal and social developments. We see the ultimate purpose of economic justice is to free each person to engage and work creatively in the world of economics, using core resources of our minds, body, and spirits.",

    "narrative3": "Low-income people are at-risk of being displaced from Portland\u2019s Cully neighborhood. Cully is a predominantly low-income, people of color neighborhood of 13,300 people located in northeast Portland. It is the most ethnically and racially diverse neighborhood in Portland. It is also one of the last close-in (west of I-205) neighborhoods in Portland that has not experienced significant public and private investment. Research indicates Cully is highly vulnerable to displacement of low-income people.\r\n\r\nLiving Cully is a combined effort by Hacienda CDC, NAYA and Verde to bring needed investments to the Cully neighborhood, like parks, affordable housing and jobs. For example, our Let Us Build Cully Park! effort is an inclusive, community-led effort to bring a much-needed park to the neighborhood (there is no developed park in Cully). This effort creates jobs, minority- and woman-owned business opportunities and ownership of the park from design to asset by community members.\r\n\r\nOur Not in Cully program is a multi-organization, multi-faceted effort to prevent displacement of low-income people from the Cully neighborhood. 6/13, we complete the design of a plan to prevent displacement. At the heart of the plan is community organizing to build power to increase incomes, empower owners/renters and empower our community to bring the assets and resources it needs to guide investment without displacement.\r\n\r\nRoot Causes. \r\nA. Low-income people and people of color do not have a multi-cultural power base from which to advocate for the jobs and investments they need in Cully.\r\n\r\nB. Low-income people and people are color are not represented by the neighborhood association, which receives much deference from city planners.\r\n\r\nC. Institutional indifference to the needs of Cully has resulted in a lack of organized investment, non-existent incorporation of low-income people and people of color into economic development, urban planning and city efforts to address disparities in wealth and access to infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBuilding Collective Power.\r\nLiving Cully partners are deeply embedded in the Cully neighborhood. We empower residents to create solutions to the problems our community by directly connecting residents to the information, resources and tools necessary to address community needs. \r\n\r\nPower Shift.\r\nCommunity organizing around the Not in Cully anti-displacement strategies creates a multi-cultural power base which results in local, state and federal decision-makers having to allocate resources to prevent displacement of low-income people in Cully. For example, the city recently adopted a resolution to create a city-community committee to anticipate and address displacement, but no action has been taken. With property values rising in Cully, accelerated action by decision-makers is essential to preventing displacement.\r\n",

We will pay honoraria to members of the committee and identify necessary training resources and pay for the training necessary to equip activists with the tools necessary for effectively leading the community in anti-displacement strategies. We will provide childcare, food and translation services, all of which are necessary for effective organizing in a low-income, people of color community.\r\n\r\nAnother key focus of the committee will be to connect with Portlanders who have experienced displacement and learn from those experiences. We will invite displaced Portlanders to share their story and pay them for their time in sharing their experience and wisdom to help our community resist displacement.\r\n\r\nThe Not in Cully anti-displacement strategies cover five areas: economic development/jobs, housing, families, community building and neighborhood businesses. Each has a set of strategies and specific activities with different organizations and agencies having primary responsibility for addressing them. For example, under economic development, we need community benefits agreements with current and prospective employers in the neighborhood. The committee gains awareness of each area, the strategies and activities under each area, identifies the implementation pathways (community organizing, policy work, etc.), identifies responsible parties/resources and prioritizes action.\r\n\r\nAssessment.\r\nWe will create milestones for committee recruitment, committee member training, committee awareness of displacement issues, engagement of city partners and plan development.", 
    "narrative5": "Verde created the Living Cully initiative (LC), a coordinated effort of HCDC, NAYA and Verde. LC maximizes the benefits of the investments and work our individual organizations are doing in the Cully neighborhood to build wealth in a low-income community. In Portland, few benefits of the sustainability accrue to communities of color and low-income people. LC reinterprets sustainability as an anti-poverty strategy by connecting people of color and low income people to the benefits of sustainability \u2013 small business opportunities, individual jobs and workforce training, youth education, environmental benefits and the livability and health benefits of green infrastructure. This is evident in all of the Living Cully Signature Projects, whether it is building Cully Park, rebuilding Villa de Clara Vista (a Hacienda affordable housing project in Cully) or Columbia Biogas (family wage jobs in a green business located in the Cully neighborhood). This is a cross-issue effort \u2013 without it, sustainability continues to produce benefits only for middle-income whites in Portland and is thus un-sustainable.\r\n\r\nVerde is part of the Coalition of Communities of Color and our executive director is the chair of the economic development subcommittee. The disparities that people of color in Multnomah County are deep and growing and our advocacy to increase economic opportunity for people of color and minority owned businesses in the growing sustainability sector is informing and advancing the Coalition\u2019s work in this area. The progressive movement around environmental sustainability continues to omit an overt analysis of class and race. Verde\u2019s work with the Coalition puts income generation and wealth building for low-income people and people of color first in discussions of sustainability. Working together, we have more impact \u2013 Verde\u2019s expertise in the green economy and the Coalition\u2019s research capacity and growing clout in decision-making circles.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Cully is the most racially diverse neighborhood in in Portland and the state of Oregon. It has a closed landfill, the lowest percentage of streets with sidewalks in Portland, no developed parks, no community center, few retail services, high un- and under-employment, 5 trailer parks, 4 strip clubs and plenty of mini markets that lack fresh food. Thanks to the hard work of Hacienda CDC, NAYA and Verde, we have a new park being built, remodeled and new affordable housing, a successful early college academy for at-risk youth, among many other community empowerment efforts and assets. Living Cully links needed investments to closing the green divide in Portland where low-income people and people of color are no longer marginalized and instead enjoy the benefits of investments like parks, sidewalks and employment opportunities. \r\n\r\nWhile Portland enjoys as reputation as a green, sustainable city, those benefits have not accrued to low income people and people of color in particular. The Living Cully partnership of Hacienda, NAYA and Verde in Cully seeks to empower low-income people and people of color in building power and wealth and to lack of investment which Cully residents experience every day and has profound impacts on the health and well-being of adults and children alike. When you don\u2019t have a sidewalk to walk on or direct bus service downtown or a place to play safely, your health decreases and your ability to generate wealth decreases. Living Cully simultaneously attacks the economic injustice and racial injustice of this history of disinvestment by bringing needed assets and by doing so in ways that do not lead to displacement of low-income people as the neighborhood improves.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "Low-income people and people of color have been displaced from inner Portland neighborhoods like Albina and Mississippi. They have not benefited from the public and private investment in these neighborhoods. Instead, they have moved further and further from the urban center, while their former neighborhoods have increased in value both in terms of property value and livability. No estimate has ever been prepared showing the amount of wealth that these populations have lost due to displacement. Now, we have a chance in the Cully neighborhood to create a different outcome, one where an existing population of low-income people and people of color can design, direct and create needed investments, and through partnership with public agencies, create the policy conditions necessary to prevent displacement. These outcomes build wealth in a low-income community that, without such action, would result in another story of economic injustice of low-income people and people of color experiencing investment in their neighborhood only to not be able to afford to live there anymore.  Under-investment in the Cully neighborhood is an economic injustice. While some areas of the city thrive, Cully lacks sidewalks, parks, retail services, etc. Living Cully and Not in Cully reverse this economic injustice by bringing those investments and doing it in a way that prevents displacement. Lastly, this work challenges the sustainability movement, a movement that is creating wealth for middle- and upper-income whites but not for low-income people and people of color. It demonstrates who we can create triple bottom line solutions in a low-income neighborhood.",

    "narrative1": "The mission of the Transit Riders Union is to build a participatory democratic union of transit riders fighting for better public transit. We are working and poor people, mostly dependent on public transit. We recognize that recent cuts to transit systems across the county are part of a bigger picture of rising inequality and a decades-long assault on our standard of living, and that ultimately only a movement of working and poor people united across racial and other divides can turn the tide. TRU aims to contribute to this movement.\r\n\r\nTRU grew out of a successful campaign to save Metro service from 17% cuts in summer 2011. We became a membership organization in June 2012, and our first major campaign protested the elimination of the downtown Ride Free Area, which thousands of low-income riders depended on for mobility and to access services. We gathered 3000 petition signatures and organized a \u201cfuneral march\u201d of 200 transit riders. Although we couldn't save the RFA, our demonstration of the hardship caused by its elimination directly influenced the King County Council's decision to consider a low income reduced fare.\r\n\r\nBus fares in King County have risen 80% since 2008, and since our foundation TRU members wanted to campaign for a low income fare. We now have a representative on the King County Low Income Options Advisory Committee, which will make recommendations to the County Council in July 2013.\r\n\r\nWe are again facing the prospect of deep service cuts in 2014. Working with a neighborhood group fighting to restore their evening bus service, we organized a \u201cMidnight March for Metro\u201d in April 2013 to demonstrate the effects of cuts on our communities: transit riders, including senior and disabled riders, end up having to walk miles up steep hills late at night to get home.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Our work addresses the defunding and dismantling of public transit systems that has intensified in the past decade; the shift toward running public transit as a business that serves only those who can afford to pay rather than a public good that benefits everyone; the displacement of low income and people of color communities by poorly-designed transit-oriented development (e.g. around new light rail stations). Our work addresses the day-to-day problems that people who depend on public transit face: how to get to work and school, medical appointments and grocery stores, how to budget for bus fare and other necessities, how much time they have to spend struggling to get from here to there instead of with friends and family.\r\n\r\nThe root causes of these issues are Washington State\u2019s regressive tax system \u2013 the worst in the country \u2013 and the decades-long rise in wealth and power inequality in the United States.  The labor unions and community organizations that once were an organized voice for many (though not all) working and poor people have declined to a historically low level, and more and more people are isolated and unengaged, struggling alone. Working and poor people today are often essentially voiceless in determining the public policies and planning processes that affect their lives. We can\u2019t expect local and state governments and agencies to reform themselves, because they are under pressure from powerful moneyed interests that, for example, prioritize the building of new highways over expanding public transit.\r\n\r\nTRU believes that the answer to these root problems is grassroots organization. We aim to build collective power by growing our membership, teaching ourselves to make democratic decisions and to become effective organizers and leaders. We aim to forge ties with all neighborhoods in Seattle and King County by holding public meetings and working with aligned organizations. A vital piece of this picture is education, and we are developing materials explaining public transit issues and relating them to the bigger picture of economic injustice; we plan to give workshops to give communities the tools they need to organize around transit justice, and we will share these materials with the diverse organizations we work with, from transportation and urban planning-focused non-profits to organizations representing seniors, people with disabilities, immigrants and refugees, religious organizations, students, community organizations, and racial, social, and economic justice organizations.\r\n\r\nBy organizing ourselves as working and poor people in an powerful democratic union, we will build the grassroots economic and political power needed to put pressure on elected officials to make public transit work for everyone, to transform our state\u2019s regressive tax system, and ultimately to change the power dynamics and achieve structural change by tipping the balance from money-power and to people-power.",

These goals are relatively straightforward: we will have met them if we succeed in preventing service cuts and win a low income fare. We anticipate having to launch a huge get-out-the-vote for a Motor Vehicle Excise Tax to fund transit in late 2013; however, even if this campaign fails it may be an important step towards fighting for more progressive transit funding in 2014 and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe project goal is to develop educational materials that TRU and other community groups can use to spread knowledge and discussion of public transit as a social and economic justice issue. We will assess our success by gathering feedback from allied organizations and transit riders.\r\n\r\nThe internal/organizational goals are: first (1), to grow TRU membership from 55 to over 200 members, with several aims in mind: (a) the greater our numbers the more people-power we have and the more effective we can be, (b) the larger our membership the more activities we can sustain with dues and the more directly accountable we will be to our membership rather than to funders, and (c) we intend to do focused recruiting in low-income, transit-dependent, and majority-people-of-color neighborhoods; and second (2), to develop from among our membership a strong core of committed organizers with diverse backgrounds and skills who can continue to build TRU and do the day-to-day work necessary to sustain a powerful grassroots organization. We will assess our success based our membership and organizer numbers and the proportion of members and organizers who are low-income, transit-dependent, and people of color.", 
    "narrative5": "In the less than one year since our first Membership Meeting the Transit Riders Union has been involved in several collaborations. In summer 2012 we joined a coalition to change Sound Transit\u2019s plans for its Northgate light rail station from development based around cars to transit, pedestrian and bicycle access. This effort succeeded in reducing parking garage spots and laying groundwork for a pedestrian bridge from Seattle Central Community College to the Northgate Transit Center.\r\nIn fall 2012 we collaborated with SHARE/WHEEL (a homeless-led organization that runs self-managed shelters and tent cities) on our Ride Free Area Funeral March, also supporting their effort to pressure the County Council to let them purchase enough reduced-rate bus tickets for their members to travel to shelters. SHARE/WHEEL brought members to our march and collected petition signatures. This demonstration of solidarity between transit riders and the homeless community was effective: SHARE/WHEEL was granted their requested bus tickets, and although the RFA was eliminated the County Council is pursuing the idea of a low income reduced fare.\r\nTRU\u2019s major collaborative effort so far, in which we have taken the leading role, is our campaign for a low income fare. We wrote a letter to the County Council in support of a strong program and built a coalition of 28 signatory organizations, including labor unions, low income and homeless organizations, religious organizations, environmental groups, and organizations representing people of color and immigrants. We continue to work with our coalition partners to win a low income fare, holding roundtable discussions, keeping them updated on the progress of the King County Low Income Options Advisory Committee, encouraging their members and constituents to submit public comment, and collaborating to gather petition signatures. If we succeed, this low income fare program will be a first for a large US city. ", 
    "narrative6": "Public transit is a perfect example of the intersection of racial injustice with economic injustice. People of color in Seattle and King County are disproportionately low income. Low income riders, in turn, disproportionately depend on public transit for basic mobility and are therefore the ones most hurt by service cuts and fare hikes. Furthermore, when transit service is cut it is usually not the rush-hour commuter runs used by better-off, majority white riders, but rather the all-day service and bus routes connecting diverse neighborhoods and widely dispersed locations that low-income, majority people-of-color riders depend on. The result is that people of color are disproportionately impacted by service cuts and fare hikes, which tend to widen the gaps of opportunity and privilege which have historically divided white people and people of color in this country.\r\n\r\nTRU aims to unite low income transit riders, both white and people of color, including immigrants, to fight for affordable, reliable and accessible public transit \u2013 both within our own democratic member-run union and by allying with organizations that represent communities of color. So far our membership is majority low income, but also majority white, so as of spring 2013 we have started to do focused recruiting in majority people-of-color neighborhoods such as Rainier Beach and Columbia City. We also intend to recruit bilingual organizers so that eventually TRU members who are not fluent in English can participate fully in our meetings and decision-making processes. TRU has already allied with organizations that represent communities of color, such as the Seattle-King County NAACP, Got Green, Casa Latina, and El Centro de la Raza, as well as unions such as UNITE HERE Local 8 that represent majority people-of-color workers. All of these groups are coalition partners in our campaign for a low income fare.\r\n\r\nPublic transit connects racial justice with economic injustice in a second respect: low-income and majority people-of-color neighborhoods are being \u201cgentrified\u201d in part because of development around new light rail stations and street car lines. Unfortunately this process began before TRU existed and is now well underway. However, we are close allies with organizations like Puget Sound Sage that continue to work to preserve affordable housing and retail/small business space in majority people of color neighborhoods where transit oriented development has led to increased property values and rents.\r\n\r\nCurrently TRU has four elected officers and all are white, so in that sense we are now a white-led organization, but as we expand our membership in majority people of color neighborhoods, and recruit and/or train from among our membership organizers and officers who are also people of color, we expect this to change.",

    "cycle_question": "Public transit is a public good that benefits everyone, but for low income riders who may have no other option, it is a lifeline. We believe that mobility should be considered a right, and as more and more working and poor people cannot afford to own cars, access to public transit is a straightforward matter of economic justice. Without reliable and affordable transportation, people cannot get to places of employment, social services, education, and to visit and care for friends and family. We become second-class citizens. Transportation in Seattle accounts for as much as 30% of a person\u2019s monthly take-home income, which is unaffordable for many; public transit should be an affordable alternative to driving, but dramatic fare increases are straining budgets that are already over-taxed for transit due to the regressive sales tax that currently constitutes the majority of Metro\u2019s funding. As low income and minority groups are pushed further out into the suburbs by rising property values, affordable, effective transit systems become even more important. TRU\u2019s work in fighting to prevent bus service cuts and to win a low income reduced fare is a vital part of the fight for economic transit justice.\r\n\r\nJust as important is our work in building a strong democratic union of working and poor people that can act in solidarity with other organizations fighting for economic justice, to push for the larger systemic changes that are ultimately needed.  We cannot change our state\u2019s regressive tax structure or make the economy work for everyone by fighting for public transit alone, but by forging strong alliances now with other groups and making ties within diverse communities we can lay foundations for the larger fights that will be necessary to resist austerity and turn the tide of inequality in the years ahead.",

This includes HIV and Hep C support groups and providing food and emergency assistance for utilities and housing when our funds allow. Additionally we have a prevention education program that includes: community education, schools, prevention education to other area service agencies, free HIV/Hep C counseling and testing, Latino outreach, volunteer training, harm reduction materials, and a syringe exchange program.\r\n\r\nBMH2H is governed by a 9-member volunteer Board of Directors. Their membership includes a client, two physicians, two social workers, a department of human services employee, and representatives from agencies serving HIV-positive individuals. With one full-time Case Manager, one Executive Director, one part-time contracts manager and accountant, and one part-time outreach coordinator, BMH2H relies upon its highly dedicated hands-on Board and other volunteers in order to most efficiently utilize scarce resources. The Latino and LGBT community are represented on our board and staff.\r\n\r\nWe remain the only agency in Southeastern Washington providing these services with the closest being three hours or more away.

    "narrative3": "Blue Mountain Heart to Heart provides essential health and prevention services to the Walla Walla community and surrounding areas. Our outreach program, Promotores de Salud, was founded in 1997 to address the growing number of Latino clients in our area. As the farm and agriculture community has expanded, the number of Latino farmworkers seen a corresponding increase in southeastern Washington. BMH2H focuses on these individuals because they are marginalized, and are often denied health services because of their immigration status. This community is especially vulnerable to HIV and sexually transmitted infections due to lack of knowledge, stigma surrounding these diseases, and unprotected sexual behaviors. The high prevalence of unprotected sex, between men who have sex with men (MSM), heterosexual couples, and with injection drug users, make this an important issue for the Latino community.\r\n\r\nThe danger of HIV and STIs remains a salient issue, as the migratory farm worker community changes every year, requiring perennial outreach efforts. Each year farm workers move out of state to find work elsewhere and new farm laborers arrive to meet the growing demand in and around Walla Walla. This rapidly changing community requires constant attention and education, and remains an important and often ignored community in the Walla Walla valley. BMH2H aims to continue providing these important resources and information to the Latino community, to prevent the spread of HIV and STI, especially as this community lacks access to health care.\r\n\r\nThrough our outreach work, BMH2H hopes to combat the stigma, stereotypes and lack of knowledge about HIV in the Latino farm worker community. BMH2H is the only agency that has made much headway with Latinos in Southeastern Washington, and we continue to educate and advocate local and state governments about the health dangers facing farm workers. Implemented and run by Latino farm workers, our prevention and outreach work involves Latino community members and encourages them to educate their peers and create an environment of open dialogue about safe sex practices. Our Latino outreach workers have high levels of credibility within the Latino community, and have built a solid relationship with different farms and agricultural businesses in the area. Our outreach workers find popular opinion leaders (POLs) within the community to help snowball the spread of information about HIV and prevention and to encourage community-based involvement. These POLs help break down the stereotypes and stigma surrounding HIV, prevention materials, and HIV testing. Through this method and the wide reach of outreach efforts (which includes prevention education, distribution of prevention materials, and free HIV testing) BMH2H outreach workers play a vital role in preventing the spread of HIV in the Latino community.\r\n",

At request of the Yellowhawk Tribe's elders, we will begin HIV and hepatitis C testing for residents of the reservation, but as they request, this testing cannot occur on the reservation itself, where it is feared that people will be too hesitant to get tested for HIV or be perceived as gay. We also want to continue our Latino-focused HIV outreach and testing, despite the expectation that the State of Washington will soon be cutting all prevention funds except to the Seattle area. Our robust outreach program reaches more than 1,500 people a year, and it is vital we continue and expand this program, especially as so few other organizations in our area provide comprehensive sexual health information to these at-risk communities. We regularly speak and test at farm labor camps, in the local juvenile justice center, on the street, and at agricultural and meat processing plants where many uninsured Latinos work. We assess our outreach program by documenting how many contacts we've made, how many tests we've performed, how many referrals we've conducted, and what outcomes we've seen among people we've tested. We also ask for feedback from our contacts and our public health partners.", 
    "narrative5": "Blue Mountain Heart to Heart works in partnership with both the Pride Foundation and the SOS Clinic of Walla Walla. The Pride Foundation provides vital funding to our organization for continued outreach in Walla Walla city to Latinos and LGBT individuals who demonstrate at-risk factors. Through their continued support, which provides our only funding for LGBT outreach, BMH2H attends monthly events at the Out and About club in Pasco, which serves mainly Latino lesbian and gay individuals. The SOS Clinic of Walla Walla, established in 2000, provides free health services and urgent care to uninsured, poor, and underserved individuals in the community. Often these individuals include Latino and uninsured migratory farmworkers. BMH2H travels to the SOS Clinic once a week to provide free HIV and Hepatitis C testing to this vulnerable and underserved community. The purpose of these partnerships exists to help BMH2H identify new HIV infections as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThrough these collaborations BMH2H acts as a trusted advisor on outreach best practices and passionately advocates for continued and visible testing. The support offered by these partnering organizations allows BMH2H to expand outreach to vulnerable individuals through trusted community connections, and to continue community HIV education, advocacy, and visibility. These collaborations allow BMH2H to build a widespread progressive movement. As BMH2H\u2019s program, Promotores de Salud, is implemented and lead by members of the Latino farmworker community, our outreach work, especially at the SOS Clinic, builds collaboration across community lines. BMH2H\u2019s outreach work advocates HIV and Hepatitis C testing in a public health context, helping to build a unified community around compassionate health issues. Finally, upcoming implementation of the Affordable Care Act will impact BMH2H advocacy, as we work to build coalitions and maintain testing and health care for underserved individuals who fall in the gap of health insurance coverage.", 
    "narrative6": "Blue Mountain Heart to Heart is an equal opportunity employer that maintains a nondiscrimination hiring policy. While Walla Walla has a primarily white demographic, BMH2H actively works to diversify its staff and Board of Directors to represent a range of ethnic and racial backgrounds. As a primarily white-led organization, BMH2H understands the importance of including a diversity of opinions and backgrounds in decision-making processes. BMH2H makes conscious and informed choices when working in communities of color, often privileging the knowledge and cultural understanding of our Latino outreach coordinator. As a primarily white ally organization BMH2H understands the power and privilege it holds when working in communities of color, and therefore we constantly reflect on our cultural competency and organizational choices to ensure our anti-racist agenda.\r\n\r\nMost of our clients at BMH2H face various and complex discrimination, based on their race, economic disadvantage, or HIV-positive status. BMH2H understands the stigma associated with these forms of discrimination, and therefore stresses the importance of an increased cultural understanding of HIV/AIDS. We advocate HIV awareness and support, especially for racial and economic minorities, to state and local representatives. We maintain support for LGBT communities in the area, such as Triple Point of Walla Walla (a local youth group for LGBT adolescents that is part of the Children\u2019s Home Society of Washington) and the Out and About club in Pasco. We provide prevention, outreach, education, and testing for the Latino farmworker community. We are also in the process of expanding our outreach to Native American communities in our region. Through our support and involvement in these communities, BMH2H continues to include resistance to racism, homophobia, and economic injustice in our HIV support and prevention services.\r\n\r\nWhile a primarily white-led organization, BMH2H\u2019s program Promotores de Salud is led and maintained by Latino individuals. As farmworkers themselves, our outreach coordinators understand the challenges and discrimination that Latino people face in Walla Walla. As members of the communities in which they work, our Latino outreach workers also understand the cultural barriers to HIV prevention, education and testing, and can effectively navigate these situations. Because BMH2H stresses the importance of cultural competency and anti-racist work in our outreach services, we have built high-levels of credibility throughout the Latino farmworker community. Due to the compounding factors of economic, race, and employment-based discrimination, BMH2H works hard to combat racism and economic injustice and to break down the stigma surrounding HIV within and outside communities of color.",

For over thirty years, Sisters\u2019 purpose has been to build community, sharing a hot, delicious meal and dignified work with those who need them. We continue to follow a community organizing model and our customers work with staff to guide both our Cafe work and political work within a strong philosophical framework. Sisters uses nonviolence, gentle personalism, anti-oppressions and economic human rights as guiding principles and philosophies in all our decision making, relationships and organizing work. We believe that all individuals are equally worthy, that no one has a monopoly on the truth, and that we have much to learn from one another. While our guiding principles are taken from the Catholic Worker movement, Sisters has no religious affiliation.\r\n\r\nA few recent accomplishments: In 2012, Sisters was awarded the Outstanding Service Award from the Oregon Psychological Association. In 2011, our former Research and Health Policy Associate was awarded the Multnomah County Josiah Hill Public Health Hero Award for her work towards social health justice. In 2008, our book Voices from the Street was a Silver Medal Winner of the 2008 Nautilus Book Awards and was nominated for two other book awards. Data for this book came from Sisters\u2019 Research Project (2001-2005), and this qualitative data is also available in a searchable database online at www.sistersoftheroad.org/voices. The book and database have been used in numerous college classes, and cited in social work research journals and textbooks. Sisters was also instrumental in the passage of legislation in the mid-1980s allowing people to use food stamps for hot meals at non-profit restaurants\u2014a critical resource for unhoused people who have no access to a kitchen to prepare meals. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "The epidemic of homelessness in the US continues year after year, and Oregon\u2019s homelessness remains above the national average. Safe and affordable housing is inaccessible to thousands of people thanks to federal divestment in public housing. So-called \u201cquality of life\u201d laws in Portland and elsewhere in the state negatively affect our community by criminalizing such acts as camping for survival. These laws echo past discriminatory laws from Oregon\u2019s history like redlining, ugly laws and sundown laws. Most recently, the Portland Business Alliance (PBA) introduced legislation to the Oregon House (HB2963) to legalize city laws limiting sitting or lying in public places. Portland\u2019s Sit/Lie Law was found to be unconstitutional in 2009, and was replaced by the slightly less Draconian Sidewalk Management Ordinance, but the PBA wants a return to the total ban on sitting or lying on the sidewalk. \r\nBeing cited under such laws often includes a fine that people living unhoused often cannot pay, compounding barriers for them to return to financial stability. Laws such as these also serve to push people experiencing homelessness into the shadows so that people who are housed do not have to think about the epidemic of poverty that exists around them. Silence and invisibility will not serve our community. A Homeless Bill of Rights in Oregon will protect our community from these attacks on human rights, build up our local and statewide anti-poverty movement, and educate people on the effects and causes of homelessness. We also hope that successful campaigns in California and Oregon will build momentum for Homeless Bills of Rights in states across the United States.\r\nFor the past several years, Sisters has been working to become a collectively managed organization. While we still have an Executive Director, each team is co-managed by team members. As a co-managed organization, we understand the importance of all people in a community sharing power. We intentionally seek out leadership from our community base. We train our community in using Sisters\u2019 meeting guidelines (meant to create a respectful space and encourage balanced participation from all people) and making decisions by consensus. Community members can also attend other trainings through this campaign, some of which teach lobbying, working with the media, base-building, and other important campaign skills. We know people from our community are the best leaders for the anti-homelessness and anti-poverty movements, and we strive to provide these people with the skills they need to take on those leadership roles. \r\n",

    "narrative4": "The primary goal of this campaign is to pass a Homeless Bill of Rights in Oregon in 2014. Secondary goals include strengthening the anti-poverty movement by building ally relationships, and educating the general populace about issues faced by people living unhoused. \r\n\r\nThe Street Outreach Committee continues to gather surveys from people experiencing homelessness, with a focus on people outside of the Portland Metro area. These surveys will inform the final bill by gathering information, input and experiences from people living unhoused. The Organizational Outreach Committee is seeking out additional supportive organizations to endorse and/or get involved with the campaign. Again, the current focus is on outreach outside the metro area. Our goal is to sign up 180 organizations in support of the HBR. The Communications Committee is working to spread the word about the campaign through social media, and is developing common talking points in conjunction with the California HBR campaign. Ally group Right 2 Survive has already produced a 3-part radio show for their monthly KBOO show about the campaign, interviewing organizers, participants and houseless people not currently engaged in the campaign about the effort. The Education Committee is building the campaign\u2019s messaging plan, including incorporating WRAP\u2019s Without Housing toolkit (which documents the 30-year decline of funding for affordable housing) as an educational tool, and Portand Copwatch\u2019s \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d materials. This committee is also planning community forums to inform our community of what the bill will and won\u2019t do. The Legislative/Legal Committee is working with chief legislative sponsor Representative Michael Dembrow on plans to secure more support for the bill from other legislators. \r\n\r\nBill concepts are due in September 2013 for the 2014 session. The Legislative/Legal Committee hopes to have a strong working draft of the legislation by that time.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Sisters is a founding member of the Western Regional Advocacy Project (WRAP), a regional social justice coalition of organizations along the West Coast that are determined to make ending homelessness a national priority.  WRAP members are building a movement for economic human rights through the campaigns Without Housing (focused on affordable housing) and Without Rights (focused on civil rights for people experiencing extreme poverty). Sisters helped in the research and writing of reports used in both these campaigns. These campaigns work hand in hand to stop the street-level disregard for poor people\u2019s civil and human rights, and to pressure the federal government to reinvest in affordable housing programs. WRAP is helping to coordinate Oregon\u2019s HBR campaign and a concurrent HBR campaign in California, with the hope of creating a national trend toward recognizing the rights of people living unhoused. Sisters\u2019 staff and community members participate in weekly calls with WRAP, and travel to its San Francisco headquarters periodically for face-to-face campaign planning meetings.\r\nSisters is a member of the Assembly to End Poverty, which emerged from the 2010 US Social Forum. Director Monica Beemer is co-chair, along with Marian Kramer, of the Assembly. Sisters\u2019 Health Advocate Michael Moore is on the Fundraising and Finance Committee. The Assembly has been convening People\u2019s Movement Assemblies across the US, bringing thousands of people together to develop strategies to fight poverty. Sisters has been able to send several community members to these events. The Assembly has also supported World Courts of Women on Poverty (led by Poor People\u2019s Economic Human Rights Campaign\u2014PPEHRC\u2014of which Sisters is also a member). Board member TwoBears was honored by being appointed as a juror in the Court held in May 2012. The Assembly is currently building toward the 2014 USSF.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Sisters is committed to creating a community in which all people are welcomed and valued. Sisters consciously works to be an anti-oppressive and anti-racist organization, not only interrupting the violence of oppressions whenever we see it, but also examining our structure to see where it is just and inclusive and where we need to grow as individuals and as an organization. Sisters also realizes the interconnectedness of oppressions, and the importance of recognizing and owning privilege where we have it. We strive to keep open communication with our community regarding oppression and privilege, and these topics are discussed frequently in our biweekly morning Coffee Talks\u2014one time we gather valuable input from our community. We understand the importance of developing with our community common language and understanding of concepts like oppression, privilege, homophobia and racism, in order to have these discussions.\r\nRacial justice is a vital piece of Sisters\u2019 ongoing work, though admittedly there is still work that needs to be done. Our new 3-year plan (consensed on this month) has four primary goals, one of which is that Sisters will \u201cuse racial justice filters as a measure in all our decisions and actions across our entire organization.\u201d Our Racial Justice/Anti-Oppressions work group is currently researching a group that will lead our organization through a two-year dismantling racism process, and our Development Team is working to secure designated funding for this process. We held our first People of Color Caucus for staff and community members a few weeks ago, in order to create space to discuss how Sisters could be a better ally to POC.\r\nSisters also works closely with ally organizations such as VOZ and CAUSA that are led by people of color and/or working on issues important to our community like immigration. \r\n",

In 2008, FEEST began under the King County Food Fitness Initiative (KCFFI) which sought community / policy driven solutions to health inequities in the Delridge and White Center communities. Originally at Youngstown Cultural Arts Center, our dinners now occur at Chief Sealth and Evergreen High Schools.  FEEST has fed over 1,300 youth and adults, trained over 43 interns and held 200+ potlucks and dinners. Each year, FEEST hires interns to lead and promote weekly dinners, who are trained as community leaders and advocates. FEEST creates the platform for young people to engage directly with policy development and systems change. FEEST is a proven model for authentic youth participation in underserved communities around the issues of community health and equity.\r\n\r\nFEEST Interns led 3 taste tests in 2 different school districts in coordination with nutrition services directors engaging over 600 students to share feedback with district nutrition services directors. Three new school food items in the Seattle School District were implemented as a result.\r\n\r\nFEEST Interns created salad bar safety educational tool kit in collaboration with the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), Washington State Department of Health (WSDH)  which included a video, posters and a list of recommendations on how to make salad bars more accessible to students. This toolkit is being shared with school nutrition services directors statewide by the WSDA and OSPI.\r\n",

The issues around health inequity are deeply connected to poverty, race and education. Sixty percent of children at 75% of White Center Schools are eligible for free or reduced price meals, which is three times higher than the King County average.\r\n\r\nFEEST seeks to create greater community health and equity.  FEEST youth identified improving school lunch as the single most important thing we could do to improve access to healthy food for youth in the community.  Our youth interns said from their experience many of their peers get 100% of their meals during school and if we could improve the meals at school we could change a lot of young people\u2019s lives. We feel the school food should reflect the cultural diversity of the community, be fresh, delicious and of high quality. Most of the youth we\u2019ve spoken to describe school food as \u201cgross\u201d or \"nasty\", while nutrition services feels the program is successful. There is a gap in understand we feel our project will begin to address.\r\n\r\nOur long term goal is to create a direct pipeline for feedback and accountability between Highline District Nutrition Services and students in the Highline School District.\r\n\r\nFour youth interns with adult support will conduct a series of assessments at Evergreen High School of current policies, access to culturally appropriate foods at lunch, student satisfaction and experience with the current school meal program. These assessments will be created and dispensed to in coordination with students, teachers, administrators, nutrition services and other community organizations to over 400 students at the 3 small schools at the Evergreen High School Campus. FEEST interns will collaborate with the WCCDA to create a report of policy recommendations and present them to the Highline School Board.\r\n\r\nThis process will enable the following outcomes:\r\n\r\n    Nutrition services and policy makers will be exposed to new information, perspectives and policy solution from students in their district.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Students will be exposed to the process of policy making within their district.\r\n\r\n\r\n     New data will be available on student\u2019s school food experience and access to culturally appropriate school foods, increasing the knowledge base of this understudied topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n    We will begin the process of building an information pipeline from students to policy makers",

    "narrative5": "FEEST is a member of  Regional Food Policy Council (RFPC) and Healthy King County Coalition. RFPC develops just and integrated policy and action recommendations that promote health, sustain and strengthen the local and regional food system, and engage and partner with agriculture, business, communities and governments in the four-county region.  The Healthy King County Coalition is working to reduce health inequities, ensure healthy and affordable food, access to physical activity, and decrease smoking and other tobacco use.\r\n\r\nFEEST is a voting member with both groups. Most of the people sitting on this bodies come from large institutions with little on the ground experience with community. FEEST's  presence ensures youth needs and experiences influence the work of the RFPC and HKCC so policy and action recommendations reflect the desires of the communities we serve. Our presence also allows us to build stronger networks within the food justice movement and be at the table for collaborations, important advocacy opportunities, and  policy discussions that have great impact on the current health in our communities.\r\n\r\nOn the ground collaborations within school have been essential to the viability and the growth of our program.  FEEST works very closely with administrators, service providers and teachers from Evergreen High School and Chief Sealth High School as well as after-school providers such as the YMCA and the Community Schools Collaboration.  By working alongside staff champions who recognize the quality of our programming, we build trustworthy networks that multiply the educational reach of after school providers and teachers.  We\u2019ve created unique food/leadership curriculums for classroom teachers at Chief Sealth that double as outreach.  \r\n\r\nFEEST recognizes our youth intern projects as powerful community collaborations.  Intern projects are built by the youth themselves while we support their drive for change. Last year, one intern's project alone, reached over 1,200 students. ",

We feel that POC adults from the neighborhood, training primarily youth of color, who subsequently go on to lead direct action of their own design in their own communities is both a natural remedy to historicized oppression and a direct-action redress of institutionalized power.  \r\n\r\nFEEST embeds liberatory practice into the fundamental tenets all of our programmatic work.

    "narrative3": "ICAN prioritizes issues that address racial, social, and economic inequalities with an understanding that the root cause of these inequalities is low income and communities of color not having the political clout necessary to advance their interests.  ICAN supports a platform with five issues that dig deep down into the root causes of poverty:\r\n1.\tFAIR LENDING-fair access to credit that is non-discriminatory and non-predatory, fair banking practices and stopping foreclosures\r\n2.\tFAIR PUBLIC FINANCE-restore funding for education and vital health services.\r\n3.\tFAIR TAXES-end tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and make them pay their fair share\r\n4.\tFAIR EMPLOYMENT-living wages and job security\r\n5.     FAIR IMMIGRATION REFORM- reform that supports family unity and a path to citizenship\r\n  \r\nICAN builds collective power through community organizing.  We believe in reaching out to meet people where they are at.  The strategies we are using to build collective power include:\r\n\u2022\tIndividual recruitment- door knocking, phone canvass,  home visits, house meetings\r\n\u2022\tInstitutional recruitment-meetings and  presentations with churches, education and labor groups\r\n\u2022\tCommunity recruitment- direct outreach to immigrants and small businesses through the radio broadcasting\r\n\u2022\tCoalition building-continuously building power-sometimes with unlikely allies \r\n\r\nICAN educates leaders about how the economic system and racism work together to create the inequity prevalent in our country.  ICAN empowers leaders to address these underlying systems through collective action.  ICAN believes that once leaders are trained, they become the best organizers for building local program bases.  ICAN members have many opportunities to receive training and education on issues and community organizing through:\r\n\u2022\tLocal issue education training\r\n\u2022\tLocal one-day community organizing training\r\n\u2022\tLocal skill development training-speech and writing \r\n\u2022\tRegional four-day organizer training\r\n\u2022\tRegional leadership development- training leaders to be trainers\r\nICAN leaders actively invest in and build strong state and national coalitions.  While we organize key constituencies in an often overlooked geography we will not make the changes we care about alone.    \r\n\u2022\tState Coalition building:  ICAN has worked to build state coalitions for Immigration Reform, on Medicaid and Pay Day lending.  These coalitions include: labor, churches, Latino and farm worker organizations, small businesses, service organizations and disability groups \r\n\u2022\tNational Coalitions and Alliances include: Alliance For A Just Society, New Bottom Line, Fair Immigration Reform Movement, National People\u2019s Action and National Council of La Raza. \r\nICAN brings analysis, policy, people from impacted communities, and an action orientation to these coalitions.\r\nProgressive systemic change is often challenging given the conservative climate in the state.  ICAN works to educate disenfranchised Idahoans using an ideology that represents a value of fairness; a value that is often absent from the conservative dialogue.  It is through this value of fairness that ICAN builds a power base that will collectively change the power dynamics and alter the political climate of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative4": "ICAN is continuously building the power necessary to create systemic changes that have a positive impact in our communities.  Our goals and objectives focus on winning concrete victories with fair lending, fair public financing and fair immigration reform.\r\nOver the next year, ICAN will take a multi-prong approach to address the predatory lending issue and takes both local and state based plans.  \r\nFirst, working with Mayor Nancolas, ICAN will organize a local campaign in the city of Caldwell for a city ordinance that will drive predatory lenders out of the city.  Second, ICAN will reach out to surrounding communities in the Treasure Valley and press for a collective action by the Treasure Valley Partnership to institute similar city ordinances that will drive predatory lenders out of the Treasure Valley. The third prong is moving a larger state wide campaign that gets to the heart of the predatory lending issue with a state rate cap of 36% on all loan products.  \r\nICAN will continue work with the Medicaid Matters coalition to secure funding of healthcare for all Idahoan\u2019s up to 138% of the poverty level.  Expanding Medicaid will help move our goal of fair financing of public programs in Idaho.  With years of cuts to education, mental, dental and physical health, our plan to ensure funding for our most vulnerable populations will include outreach and base building with people directly impacted.\r\nFinally, ICAN will continue to support a larger campaign for fair immigration reform. With a strong desire to bring families out of the shadows and allow them compete fairly and safely in our economy we will continue support a national solution.  ICAN will continue to engage all communities in the value the immigrant communities bring to our economy.\r\nWe will assess meeting our objectives based on concrete victories.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "At ICAN we strongly value the building of coalitions at both state and national levels as a tool for creating a larger movement.  Adding to the previous list of national affiliations, ICAN also prioritizes state collaborations as a strategy for building a more progressive climate and to win on local issues in Idaho.\r\nICAN created a fair lending coalition last year to build power for a state rate cap on payday and title loans. Working with Debt Reduction Services of Idaho, Catholic Charities of Idaho, Voices of the Poor (Committee of Society of St. Vincent de Paul), AARP and Community Action Partnership, we believe we are in a stronger position to win this rate cap in 2014.\r\nICAN also created a state based coalition for fair immigration reform. With this collaboration that includes many diverse groups like the Community Council of Idaho, we have been able to move Congressional delegate to support a path to citizenship.\r\nAt times we have found \"unlikely\" allies who support our issues.  With immigration reform, ICAN found support from the Idaho Dairyman Association.  With the fair lending campaign, ICAN found support from Debt Reduction Services.  We believe collaborating with diverse groups impacted by the issue helps make our voice more powerful and helps create both short term victories and long term movement building as it shows intersections of shared principles and values.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "ICAN strongly believes in racial justice and we recognize the connection between racism and social and economic justice.  With a historical past of being a primarily white-led organization, ICAN built a program called Community Dialogues as a tool to talk about immigration in predominately white communities. \r\nIn addition to learning about the current broken system for immigration, participants in this program gain a new understanding of the positive impact immigrants have in our communities. This tool has been successful in helping to bridge the divide between Latino and white communities and has moved our membership to look at all of our issues through a racial justice lens.\r\nWith this different perspective, we can take a second look at an issue, fair lending for example, and see that predatory lending disproportionately impacts people of color.  In this case, predatory lenders establish businesses more often in communities of color. It then becomes clear that to win on this issue, we must build a diverse base that includes representation from all communities impacted.\r\nICAN stands with the Gay and Lesbian communities against homophobia.  This has been a key principle in immigration reform as advanced through our alliance with FIRM.   \r\nICAN advances a racial justice perspective on every issue ICAN prioritizes.  Bringing diverse communities together to speak their truth about how the issues are impacting them, and then letting them see the same issue from the perspective of  someone from another community is powerful. The desire to do something about the issue turns into a passion for justice through this lens and tends to have a powerful transformative effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

GJL has grown into an active membership base of over 50 trans* people and their allies who strive \u201cto fight oppression based on gender and sexuality in Washington State and to create a community where trans* people can live their lives safely, true to themselves, and free from discrimination.\u201d GJL empowers trans* activists to make positive social change in their communities through democratic decision making that prioritizes education, leadership development, and grassroots organizing. \r\n\r\nDespite its short history, GJL has the organizational capacity and skilled membership necessary to implement effective programming and events. As the organization has taken shape over the last eight months and started to build its base, GJL\u2019s members have laid out an ambitious agenda. To date, GJL has worked with Gender Odyssey to provide trans* sensitivity training in area schools and collaborated with the People of Color Against AIDS Network to address the alarming rates of HIV in the trans* community. GJL has also provided trainings to 15 other social service agencies, government agencies, and medical providers. Moving forward, public events such as Trans* Pride and Trans* Town Hall will become annual events in the community. \r\n\r\nAn important area of policy currently being driven by GJL members is the removal of trans* healthcare exclusions on a state-wide level. GJL is leading a coalition of LGBTQ groups, including Basic Rights Oregon whose advocacy secured trans*-inclusive healthcare in Oregon, to lay the groundwork on this issue and to see it through to its passage.\r\n\r\nThis diverse mix of public events, small group trainings, policy advocacy, and internal empowerment work represents the essence of GJL and its future.

    "narrative3": "Trans* activists formed GJL to increase the capacity to address the root causes of transphobia and homophobia that trans* people face on a daily basis. The gender binary, which dictates that people must meet certain definitions of masculinity or femininity, is the primary source of transphobia and is enforced through both subtle and violent means. Rigid adherence to the gender binary in institutions such as schools, hospitals, housing assistance programs, prisons, and government agencies significantly affects those who cannot change their legal identification or safely access public or private spaces that are segregated by gender. Often times trans* people are not able to obtain proper identification, access public bathrooms safely, secure employment, or even find safe housing as homeless shelters are frequently segregated by gender and are notorious for sexual violence committed against trans* people. This gendered form of control is mediated by trans* peoples' intersecting identities, such as their race, ability, age, and class. The inability to seamlessly access societal institutions due to their gender identity and expression significantly impacts trans* peoples' life outcomes, leading to increased poverty, criminalization, and discrimination.\r\n\r\nAs reported by the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS), trans* people are twice as likely to be unemployed as non-trans people and 90% report being harassed and discriminated against on the job. Due to these challenges in the workforce, trans* people are four times more likely to live in extreme poverty with an annual income of less than ten thousand dollars and often engage in sex work and other activities in the survival economy to make ends meet. This economic marginalization and social stigma takes a devastating toll on the community: 41% of trans* people surveyed reported having attempted suicide, 25 times the national average.  GJL believes that these sobering statistics are reflective of the conditions of local trans* communities. Preliminary results from focus groups sampling the Seattle trans* population reflect this immense social and economic inequality highlighted in the NTDS.\r\n\r\nTo address these root causes, GJL mobilizes on multiple levels, including the individual, collective, and systemic levels. On an individual level, GJL empowers trans* people to build the critical analysis, self-care skills, and self-confidence necessary to love themselves, a radical act in a transphobic society. Organizationally, GJL recognizes that power is built from the bottom-up, not top-down. Members of GJL develop a shared theory of change that addresses the root causes of transphobia and prioritizes community organizing and mobilization as a part of a broader social movement to dismantle systems of oppression. This political framework is useful for identifying institutional targets of trans* activism, such as state healthcare laws that discriminate against trans* people in Washington.\r\n",

    "narrative4": "As a relatively new organization, GJL is in its community building stage. With a solid base of over 50 members, GJL is engaging in ongoing recruitment, especially of trans* people of color and low-income trans* people. With significant organizational momentum going into Trans* Pride in June, GJL hopes to increase its visibility and dig deeper into issues the trans community is passionate about. \r\n\r\nWith an increased public profile, GJL will host a Trans* Town Hall in August. This event will be a panel discussion with a diverse array of trans* activists and the audience engaging in dialogue about the history of the trans community, its present conditions, and its future, concluding with action steps to address community problems. \r\n\r\nFollowing a busy summer with a significant public presence, GJL will focus on internal work through the Trans* Leadership Retreat, a forum for sharpening the skills of existing leaders and training new activists. The retreat will be led by outside facilitators facilitating an anti-oppression curriculum.\r\n\r\nIn the next six to twelve months, GJL hopes to further expand its reach on a state-wide level. Talks between multiple organizations have begun about organizing an advocacy day in Olympia in early 2014. Furthermore, current high-level strategy sessions being led by GJL regarding the removal of trans* health care exclusions in Washington will hopefully blossom into public advocacy within a year, at which point GJL will focus on mobilizing the trans* community for the policy's passage.\r\n\r\nGJL is intensely reflective and self-critical in the evaluation of its work. Benchmarks for meeting our goals include calculating any increase in membership, determining the effectiveness of leaders, assessing GJL's public profile and visibility, and tracking significant victories on important issues. This data collection and analysis will be led by GJL's data expert, a trans-identified Masters in Social Work student.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "GJL's goal is to be a powerful force in the growth of a social justice movement for trans* people through community building, education, leadership development, and advocacy. GJL attempts to do this work in a cross-movement and intersectional approach that recognizes the multiple identities and experiences of each trans* person. Centering the need for collaboration as a key step toward building a broad-based social change movement, GJL has worked with groups to attempt to remove healthcare exclusions for trans* people in Washington and has supported economic justice through a statement from LGBTQ Allyship signed by multiple organizations, including GJL.\r\n\r\nGJL is now leading a state-wide effort to remove healthcare exclusions for trans* people by working with the ACLU, Legal Voice, Equal Rights Washington, Ingersoll Gender Center, and other activists in the LGBTQ community. These high-level talks about strategy will later evolve into mobilization to pressure the legislature to enact this policy change. With collaboration between a diverse set of leaders and with significant organizational backing, GJL believes that trans health care exclusions can be outlawed in our state.\r\n\r\nGJL has also collaborated with LGBTQ Allyship to support economic justice. Recently LGBTQ Allyship circulated a petition to urge the Space Needle to fly the Pride flag in June and to demand the negotiation of a fair union contract with its employees that includes a living wage, meaningful benefits, job security, and stronger anti-discrimination policies. Ten groups, including GJL, banded together to submit this statement to the owners of the Space Needle, an action supported by the Seattle LGBT Commission. Only with such strong community support in solidarity with Space Needle workers will the owners be forced to negotiate a fair contract. \r\n\r\nThese collaborations represent starting points toward uniting a diversity of communities into a broad social movement seeking justice for all.", 
    "narrative6": "As a primarily white-led organization with multiracial membership, GJL actively engages in ally work to fight racism in solidarity with organizations led and consisting primarily of people of color. As a part of our theory of change, GJL recognizes that racism is deeply rooted in this country's history and must be actively dismantled. GJL seeks to create an anti-racist community that is both striving individually and evolving collectively to support each other by building the strong personal relationships and human connections that are the source of undoing oppression.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with our values of anti-racism work and collaboration, GJL has collaborated with the People of Color Against AIDS Network (POCAAN) to do cross trainings on anti-racism work and trans* cultural competency. This relationship between GJL and POCAAN is an accessible means toward the goal of increasing access to HIV testing for trans* people of color, white trans* people, and non-trans* people of color. By including Gay City Health Project as well, the goal is to form a coordinated program between the three agencies to increase access to HIV testing for the populations we work with, all of whom are at high risk for AIDS/HIV. This program would also act as a gateway to HIV vaccination clinical trials at the University of Washington for the trans* community and communities of color, led by Ro Yoon, a GJL member who is a trans-identified woman of color.\r\n\r\nThe work being done by GJL and POCAAN takes place at the intersection of trans* and racial justice by recognizing that both the trans* community and people of color are at  significantly greater risk for HIV infection than the general population. For example, trans* women are almost 50 times more likely to be infected by HIV according to a study done by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Similarly, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the African American community faces rates of HIV infection that are almost 10 times higher than the infection rate among whites. For trans* women of color the HIV infection rates are higher still. This shared and overlapping community-wide vulnerability paves the road for a natural collaboration between GJL and POCAAN.\r\n\r\nGJL's work with POCAAN is a concrete example of the intersectional approach that is central to our work. GJL hopes to form more natural alliances with groups of color on issues such as the staggering rate of unemployment, discrimination in the workplace, inadequate access to safe and affordable housing, skyrocketing incarceration rates, the criminalization of immigration, and the ability to access affordable health care, all issues that disproportionately affect people of color, the trans* community, and trans* people of color in particular. \r\n",

    "narrative1": "The mission of the Transit Riders Union is to build a participatory democratic union of transit riders fighting for better public transit. We are working and poor people, mostly dependent on public transit. We recognize that recent cuts to transit systems across the county are part of a bigger picture of rising inequality and a decades-long assault on our standard of living, and that ultimately only a movement of working and poor people united across racial and other divides can turn the tide. TRU aims to contribute to this movement.\r\n\r\nTRU grew out of a successful campaign to save Metro service from 17% cuts in summer 2011. We became a membership organization in June 2012, and our first major campaign protested the elimination of the downtown Ride Free Area, which thousands of low-income riders depended on for mobility and to access services. We gathered 3000 petition signatures and organized a \u201cfuneral march\u201d of 200 transit riders. Although we couldn't save the RFA, our demonstration of the hardship caused by its elimination directly influenced the King County Council's decision to consider a low income reduced fare.\r\n\r\nBus fares in King County have risen 80% since 2008, and since our foundation TRU members wanted to campaign for a low income fare. We now have a representative on the King County Low Income Options Advisory Committee, which will make recommendations to the County Council in July 2013.\r\n\r\nWe are again facing the prospect of deep service cuts in 2014. Working with a neighborhood group fighting to restore their evening bus service, we organized a \u201cMidnight March for Metro\u201d in April 2013 to demonstrate the effects of cuts on our communities: transit riders, including senior and disabled riders, end up having to walk miles up steep hills late at night to get home.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Our work addresses the defunding and dismantling of public transit systems that has intensified in the past decade; the shift toward running public transit as a business that serves only those who can afford to pay rather than a public good that benefits everyone; the displacement of low income and people of color communities by poorly-designed transit-oriented development (e.g. around new light rail stations). Our work addresses the day-to-day problems that people who depend on public transit face: how to get to work and school, medical appointments and grocery stores, how to budget for bus fare and other necessities, how much time they have to spend struggling to get from here to there instead of with friends and family.\r\n\r\nThe root causes of these issues are Washington State\u2019s regressive tax system \u2013 the worst in the country \u2013 and the decades-long rise in wealth and power inequality in the United States.  The labor unions and community organizations that once were an organized voice for many (though not all) working and poor people have declined to a historically low level, and more and more people are isolated and unengaged, struggling alone. Working and poor people today are often essentially voiceless in determining the public policies and planning processes that affect their lives. We can\u2019t expect local and state governments and agencies to reform themselves, because they are under pressure from powerful moneyed interests that, for example, prioritize the building of new highways over expanding public transit.\r\n\r\nTRU believes that the answer to these root problems is grassroots organization. We aim to build collective power by growing our membership, teaching ourselves to make democratic decisions and to become effective organizers and leaders. We aim to forge ties with all neighborhoods in Seattle and King County by holding public meetings and working with aligned organizations. A vital piece of this picture is education, and we are developing materials explaining public transit issues and relating them to the bigger picture of economic injustice; we plan to give workshops to give communities the tools they need to organize around transit justice, and we will share these materials with the diverse organizations we work with, from transportation and urban planning-focused non-profits to organizations representing seniors, people with disabilities, immigrants and refugees, religious organizations, students, community organizations, and racial, social, and economic justice organizations.\r\n\r\nBy organizing ourselves as working and poor people in an powerful democratic union, we will build the grassroots economic and political power needed to put pressure on elected officials to make public transit work for everyone, to transform our state\u2019s regressive tax system, and ultimately to change the power dynamics and achieve structural change by tipping the balance from money-power and to people-power.",

These goals are relatively straightforward: we will have met them if we succeed in preventing service cuts and win a low income fare. We anticipate having to launch a huge get-out-the-vote for a Motor Vehicle Excise Tax to fund transit in late 2013; however, even if this campaign fails it may be an important step towards fighting for more progressive transit funding in 2014 and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe project goal is to develop educational materials that TRU and other community groups can use to spread knowledge and discussion of public transit as a social and economic justice issue. We will assess our success by gathering feedback from allied organizations and transit riders.\r\n\r\nThe internal/organizational goals are: first (1), to grow TRU membership from 55 to over 200 members, with several aims in mind: (a) the greater our numbers the more people-power we have and the more effective we can be, (b) the larger our membership the more activities we can sustain with dues and the more directly accountable we will be to our membership rather than to funders, and (c) we intend to do focused recruiting in low-income, transit-dependent, and majority-people-of-color neighborhoods; and second (2), to develop from among our membership a strong core of committed organizers with diverse backgrounds and skills who can continue to build TRU and do the day-to-day work necessary to sustain a powerful grassroots organization. We will assess our success based our membership and organizer numbers and the proportion of members and organizers who are low-income, transit-dependent, and people of color.", 
    "narrative5": "In the less than one year since our first Membership Meeting the Transit Riders Union has been involved in several collaborations. In summer 2012 we joined a coalition to change Sound Transit\u2019s plans for its Northgate light rail station from development based around cars to transit, pedestrian and bicycle access. This effort succeeded in reducing parking garage spots and laying groundwork for a pedestrian bridge from Seattle Central Community College to the Northgate Transit Center.\r\nIn fall 2012 we collaborated with SHARE/WHEEL (a homeless-led organization that runs self-managed shelters and tent cities) on our Ride Free Area Funeral March, also supporting their effort to pressure the County Council to let them purchase enough reduced-rate bus tickets for their members to travel to shelters. SHARE/WHEEL brought members to our march and collected petition signatures. This demonstration of solidarity between transit riders and the homeless community was effective: SHARE/WHEEL was granted their requested bus tickets, and although the RFA was eliminated the County Council is pursuing the idea of a low income reduced fare.\r\nTRU\u2019s major collaborative effort so far, in which we have taken the leading role, is our campaign for a low income fare. We wrote a letter to the County Council in support of a strong program and built a coalition of 28 signatory organizations, including labor unions, low income and homeless organizations, religious organizations, environmental groups, and organizations representing people of color and immigrants. We continue to work with our coalition partners to win a low income fare, holding roundtable discussions, keeping them updated on the progress of the King County Low Income Options Advisory Committee, encouraging their members and constituents to submit public comment, and collaborating to gather petition signatures. If we succeed, this low income fare program will be a first for a large US city. ", 
    "narrative6": "Public transit is a perfect example of the intersection of racial injustice with economic injustice. People of color in Seattle and King County are disproportionately low income. Low income riders, in turn, disproportionately depend on public transit for basic mobility and are therefore the ones most hurt by service cuts and fare hikes. Furthermore, when transit service is cut it is usually not the rush-hour commuter runs used by better-off, majority white riders, but rather the all-day service and bus routes connecting diverse neighborhoods and widely dispersed locations that low-income, majority people-of-color riders depend on. The result is that people of color are disproportionately impacted by service cuts and fare hikes, which tend to widen the gaps of opportunity and privilege which have historically divided white people and people of color in this country.\r\n\r\nTRU aims to unite low income transit riders, both white and people of color, including immigrants, to fight for affordable, reliable and accessible public transit \u2013 both within our own democratic member-run union and by allying with organizations that represent communities of color. So far our membership is majority low income, but also majority white, so as of spring 2013 we have started to do focused recruiting in majority people-of-color neighborhoods such as Rainier Beach and Columbia City. We also intend to recruit bilingual organizers so that eventually TRU members who are not fluent in English can participate fully in our meetings and decision-making processes. TRU has already allied with organizations that represent communities of color, such as the Seattle-King County NAACP, Got Green, Casa Latina, and El Centro de la Raza, as well as unions such as UNITE HERE Local 8 that represent majority people-of-color workers. All of these groups are coalition partners in our campaign for a low income fare.\r\n\r\nPublic transit connects racial justice with economic injustice in a second respect: low-income and majority people-of-color neighborhoods are being \u201cgentrified\u201d in part because of development around new light rail stations and street car lines. Unfortunately this process began before TRU existed and is now well underway. However, we are close allies with organizations like Puget Sound Sage that continue to work to preserve affordable housing and retail/small business space in majority people of color neighborhoods where transit oriented development has led to increased property values and rents.\r\n\r\nCurrently TRU has four elected officers and all are white, so in that sense we are now a white-led organization, but as we expand our membership in majority people of color neighborhoods, and recruit and/or train from among our membership organizers and officers who are also people of color, we expect this to change.",

    "narrative3": "The CCC works to address the racial disparities that challenge the success of all our children and families.  Communities of color are challenged in our region by a multitude of disparities in social indicators to the human services systems designed to provide aid and support to the micro arena where people of color encounter daily disparities such as racial harassment, discrimination and damaging discourses.  The CCC, in partnership with researchers at Portland State University, has spent the last four years documenting these disparities in Multnomah County and released comprehensive reports demonstrating that disparities are massive, growing, and worse in comparison with other regions and national averages.  The findings are in our Unsettling Profile series available online at www.coalitioncommunitiescolor.org.  \r\n\r\nAt the root of racial inequities in our region are racism and white privilege.  The solution to the issues we seek to address is the widespread dismantling of racism and its ideological, systemic and behavioral dimensions.  Simultaneously, white privilege (and its composite dimensions) must be deconstructed.  The pervasive inequities in our region are further deepened by 1) dominant discourses that deprioritize racial justice initiatives by framing Portland as overwhelming white and overwhelming liberal thereby calling into question the need for movements that centralize race, racism, white privilege and the advancement of racial justice; and 2) disempowered and/or invisible communities of color and immigrant and refugee communities, limited pathways for social inclusion, decreased civic engagement and networking opportunities in communities of color, and the lack of culturally-specific social capital.  \r\n\r\nThe CCC builds collective power through prioritizing the following strategies: leadership development, policy analysis and advocacy, culturally-appropriate data and research, equity-based funding, and partnership and coalition building.  We have initiatives in each of the following areas: community and economic development, education, health and human services, and leadership development.  Leadership development in communities of color is both a prioritized strategy and prioritized work area that seeks to build power by creating a stronger pipeline of leaders of color with more development opportunities, a denser network of connections linking leaders of color to each other and to leadership opportunities, and the dismantling of structural racism that constrains all our communities.\r\n\r\nOur work changes the root causes and underlying power dynamics of racial inequities by advancing a theory of change with the following outcomes: increased advocacy capacity in communities of color, shifted social discourses and frames, shifted practices at the non-policy level, reformed policy practices, improved policy outcomes, measured community impacts, and built social impacts.  Our leadership development initiative specifically addresses the root cause of unsupported social capital in communities of color.  This project seeks to specifically address the root cause of harmful dominant discourses in our region that hold back racial justice movements.  \r\n",

    "narrative4": "The CCC seeks a partnership with the Social Justice Fund to support our goal of advancing racial justice by resourcing strategic communications that create new discourses and frames around race in our region.  A crucial component of the CCC\u2019s theory of change is the need to shift dominant discourses.  How an issue is framed and the way that people understand and speak about an issue reveals the value-bases of the issue.  These practices of language are called discourses and reveal social norms and values.  Our goal is to shift the way race and racial justice get framed and discussed.  Strategic communications by and for communities of color to overcome dominant discourses around race are often not funded by mainstream funders; rather, mainstream funders tend to support mainstream entities to test messaging and framing on communities of color.  We want to partner with the Social Justice Fund to create a new paradigm that supports communities of color to frame the issues that most impact them.  \r\n\r\nThe CCC will assess whether we have met our objectives and goals by evaluating the impacts and outcomes of our strategic communications, including whether our work is clearly understood by our constituents (dissemination practices are reaching broadly into the community and we are using effective messaging to reach our constituents and our allies); whether our work is understood by our targets (policy-makers and decision-makers); and whether we are building public awareness of our issues framed in our way.  Ultimately, the real test of this work is whether our frames begin to replace dominant frames, including evaluating whether our language and terminology is used in media coverage, whether our work is influencing political debate, and whether we are changing how policy makers and the public consider our issues.  \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Included below are two education-related networks: Cradle to Career and the Oregon Alliance for Education Equity.\r\n\r\nThe CCC convenes a cross-sector Cradle to Career collaborative to advance racial educational equity in Multnomah County.  As lead convener our role is to manage and coordinate the collaborative, align leadership and engage stakeholders, utilize continuous improvement, communicate the work, and ensure sustainability.  Current work is focused on the implementation of a shared action plan.  The goal of the action plan is that by 2014-2015, 100% of organizations in the partnership will implement policies and practices that create measurable improvements in outcomes for all students, with a specific focus on students of color advancing at an accelerated rate of improvement.  The collaborative crosses sector constituency lines.  Its member composition was formed with the direct intention of bringing local institutions together with the communities most impacted by educational inequities.  For information, contact Nate Waas Shull, All Hands Raised, nate@allhandsraised.org, 503-234-5404.\r\n\r\nThe CCC participates as a general member and steering committee member in the Oregon Alliance for Education Equity.  The Alliance is a non-partisan coalition of community organizations that represent communities of color, English Language Learners, education advocates, families/parents, allies and other stakeholders who are united to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in education and ensure that students of color and students learning English graduate from high school prepared to be successful adults and global citizens.  As a steering committee member, the CCC takes on additional responsibilities including sharing in meeting coordination and facilitation, Alliance member engagement, and setting the organization\u2019s overall agenda.  The Alliance crosses geographic constituency lines by focusing on representation from across Oregon to address state-wide issues.

    "narrative6": "The CCC works to advance racial justice by prioritizing community and economic development, education, health and human services, and leadership development.  Our goals are outlined below.\r\n\u2022\tCommunity and Economic Development.  Our goals are to increase the hiring, retention and promotion of people of color in the public sector; increase the capacity of communities of color to participate in environmental sustainability initiatives; increase minority-owned businesses\u2019 access to public contracting, capital and technical support; create a vision of economic vitality and neighborhood stability; and strengthen relationships between community-based organizations of color and the private sector.\r\n\u2022\tEducation.  Our goals are to convene the Eliminating Disparities Cradle to Career collaborative; build partnerships with educational allies across Oregon to advance promising practices to eliminate the opportunity and achievement gaps; continue the partnership with Portland Public Schools and develop its learning potential; and become a clearinghouse for educational equity work in our region.\r\n\u2022\tHealth and Human Services.  Our goals are to support and expand culturally-specific service provision; support and expand culturally-responsive service provision; advocate for culturally-appropriate data and research practices; increase the hiring, retention and promotion of people of color in service-providing entities; and provide technical assistance to dominant culture social service providers.\r\n\u2022\tLeadership Development.  Our goals are to implement a cross-cultural leadership development program that links culturally-specific leadership cohorts to leadership opportunities, networks leaders, and integrates leaders of color into CCC advocacy and wider systems change work; and develop leaders in the African, African American, Asian and Pacific Islander, Latino, Native American and Slavic communities who are equipped to take on leadership roles and advocacy activities in local communities and wider society. \r\n\r\nThe CCC\u2019s advancement of racial justice addresses other forms of oppression.  Addressing issues of race brings significant benefits to other communities facing inequities.  Inequities that exist within oppressed communities are most severe when people of color hold multiple oppressed identities.  The CCC supports initiatives that address all forms of oppression, and we recognize that one-size-fits-all equity initiatives end up inadequately addressing any community.  Maintaining an explicit focus on race is essential to advancing equity across our community.  Too often, equity conversations quickly move beyond race due to what researchers term the \"race to innocence\" whereby white individuals with oppressed identities will identify as primarily carrying an oppressed identity making a maintained focus on race difficult and a deconstruction of white privilege impossible.  The CCC strongly believes that improving outcomes for people of color will improve outcomes for everyone in our community and we prioritize partnership and coalition building with allies to ensure that we successfully build a strong and inclusive social justice movement in our region.   \r\n",

We work to create opportunities for meaningful participation in decision-making and build power to address root causes of environmental racism and oppression. OPAL is the preeminent grassroots environmental justice organization in Portland metro, with long-standing relationships in the community and a track record of successful movement building and organizing. In 2010, after having carried air quality and asthma education and outreach to East Portland communities, OPAL transitioned to a Transit Justice and Health Equity program to respond to the community\u2019s critical needs and priorities. OPAL\u2019s Bus Riders Unite program is a membership-driven campaign to mobilize transit-dependent riders to advocate for equitable investments and opportunities for meaningful public participation decision-making. After more than three years of grassroots community organizing and campaign prioritization, OPAL has built a BRU membership base with a core of committed leaders and approximately 50 dues-paying members, with over 35 organizational allies in the region. Poised to win our first Campaign for a Fair Transfer (extending transfer times to three hours), having assessed over 100 bus stops in East Portland, and building a region-wide coalition for preserving and extending YouthPass, OPAL is on the verge of taking the next big step.\r\n\r\nMajor accomplishments:\r\n\u2022\tWon TriMet commitment to establish Transit Equity Committee\r\n\u2022\tPreserved ability to make round-trip transfers during 2012 TriMet budget cut negotiations\r\n\u2022\tSecured $1M from TriMet\u2019s Contingency Fund to establish a low-income rider mitigation program to offset fare hikes\r\n\u2022\tDeveloped BRU Budget Alternative to propose transit-rider endorsed budget priorities\r\n\u2022\tMember of Transit Riders for Public Transportation coalition to advocate for federal public transit and Civil Rights restoration\r\n\u2022\tFounding member and current vice-chair of Governor's Task Force on Environmental Justice",

    "narrative3": "TriMet (Portland\u2019s transit authority) is lauded as a national model for progressive transportation, largely due to the region's light-rail (MAX) system, which receives the majority of federal, state and local resources, while core bus service is consistently cut. Rail development has largely benefited more affluent commuters and those fortunate to live near the service. Transit riders that rely predominantly on the bus have been negatively impacted, jeopardizing the health equity of our region. We have a clear two-caste system, with 21st Century rail and 20th Century bus, and with transit-dependent riders unable to keep pace with annual fare hikes.\r\n\r\nDespite recent demographic changes in the region, this power imbalance persists. As part of the FY13 budget, the TriMet board approved an historic fare hike, cut bus service for the fifth straight year and eliminated the Free Rail zone. A majority of all cash/ticket TriMet boardings (56%) are now made by transit-dependent riders, with a disproportionate number of people of color given their relative lack of access to personal automobiles (32% v. 19%). People of color and low-income are also more likely to transfer between lines, meaning longer wait times and more missed connections. Compounding these disparities is an agency that is neither transparent nor accountable to its riders. There are no transit-dependent riders on the TriMet Board (and only one regular rider!), who are appointed by the Governor with no public input, and no meaningful process to engage riders in fundamental and critical decisions.\r\n\r\nOPAL\u2019s strategy to change this unjust dynamic is to institutionalize Bus Riders Unite and build power with transit-dependent riders to influence decision-making. Over the past three years, OPAL has built the BRU membership and social capital through grassroots organizing, education and leadership development. BRU forced TriMet to change their practice so as to allow public comment before making decisions (as opposed to relegating all testimony to the general public comment period at the end of meetings). TriMet\u2019s board and staff are increasingly aware of the need for a greater focus on transit equity, publicly agreeing to OPAL\u2019s proposal for a standing Transit Equity Committee made up of transit-dependent riders.\r\n\r\nOPAL\u2019s primary goal is to facilitate and support members to take greater ownership of BRU. We recently concluded our first BRU Membership Retreat, establishing formal rules and decision-making, membership criteria and leadership structure, subcommittees and priorities, a recruitment, orientation and retention strategy, a grassroots fundraising strategy, and a timeline for finalizing this transition of BRU from OPAL staff to the leaders and members. Through leadership development, BRU will have a leading role in TriMet's Transit Equity Committee, influencing the decision-making of its Board through public testimony and direct action, and changing the narrative for our region.",

The curriculum will prioritize the racial and social justice values underlying YouthPass, and will explore the relationship between transportation, housing and health to empower emerging youth leaders to broadly frame issues through a sustainability and environmental justice lens. Our goal is to establish that youth transit access is more than a civil right \u2013 that in an urban American environment, it\u2019s a basic human right - and that regardless of where you live, the color of your skin, or how much money your family has, youth have the freedom of mobility and opportunity. ECO YouthPass also meets triple-bottom line sustainability goals: it saves the state and schools money, it's critical for the environment, and it meets social equity needs for our communities. Ensuring equal access to opportunities for positive healthy outcomes for East Portland youth will have a significant impact on the quality of their lives, and works to advance a critical gap that is not currently being addressed. Our approach is grounded in youth-adult partnership and positive youth development theory, ensuring that youth are leading these efforts, with adults playing a supporting role. We will also work to integrate youth leadership into our existing Bus Riders Unite membership program. We will evaluate success by the number of emerging youth leaders that participate in our workshop series and BRU activities; by the number of stakeholders committed to our coalition; and by the increased public awareness around the connection between transit equity and youth access to opportunity.",

OPAL's role is to facilitate the coalition, broaden its reach throughout the state, and connect non-traditional partners to fight for housing justice, making the connection between housing, transportation and health outcomes.\r\n\r\nOPAL also has engaged in a formal partnership with the Multnomah Youth Commission to support and work with their Sustainability Committee and emerging youth leaders. MYC is the official youth policy body for both Multnomah County and the City of Portland, made up of a diverse group of young people, ages 13-21, that strives to provide a voice for youth in the County & City's work. The MYC works to change policy affecting young people, as well as stereotypical community perceptions. It's Sustainability Committee has recently undergone significant turnover, and is currently led by a majority of youth of color from East Portland. This Committee is focused exclusively on maintaining and extending YouthPass, and reached out to OPAL in September 2012 to formally partner in a capacity-building and leadership development role. Currently, MYC is looking to OPAL and our youth organizer to facilitate and lead these workshops and the development and an initiation of a YouthPass campaign to bring the benefit to East Portland.", 
    "narrative6": "Race, ethnic and class discrimination, along with progressive paternalism, are the root causes of environmental injustice. Environmental health inequities persist due to institutional discrimination, exclusionary policies and practices, and tokenism. OPAL works to dismantle oppressive structures within our organization by intentionally being led by those who are most impacted by environmental injustice. OPAL\u2019s campaign work is driven by people of color and working-class people, our Bus Riders Unite transit justice work is driven by those who are transit-dependent, and all our grassroots organizing intentionally targets low-income families and communities of color in outreach and engagement and leadership opportunities. We strive to have an organization and structure representative of the communities within which we work, and are majority POC-led (though currently the Executive Director is white). Our board is 50% POC, our staff is 60% POC, our core leadership is 60% POC, and our membership is approximately 40% POC. However, we are multi-racial, with an overarching focus on working with low-income people, regardless of race, and as such, attract a lot of poor white members, as well as more privileged white allies.

Our legislative successes include:\r\n\r\n* Basic Needs:\r\nWe successfully advocated for a system to provide food assistance to Washington immigrants (1997); helped create the Apple Health program, which provides healthcare coverage for Washington children, regardless of immigration status (2008); and organized a Save Our Safety Net campaign that held the line against new cuts to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (2012).\r\n\r\n* Consumer Protections:\r\nWe were instrumental in passing: 1) more consumer protection bills than had passed in the previous two decades combined (2008), including six bills that protect consumers against predatory mortgage lenders; 2) a 2009 payday lending law that has saved Washingtonians over $137 million and may serve as a national model; and 3) the Washington Foreclosure Fairness Act (2011). We have also been able to resist efforts by predatory financial industries to weaken or repeal consumer protection legislation (2012 and 2013) in our state through member-driven direct action.\r\n\r\nPoverty Action functions as the advocacy arm of Solid Ground, though we are governed by our own Coordinating Board.",

    "narrative3": "The heart of Poverty Action\u2019s work is building political power among people with low incomes and people of color who are typically left out of political processes. With large corporations pouring money into campaigns, lawmakers often feel little accountability to people who cannot make large contributions. Moreover, these same corporations spend large amounts of money to prevent people with low incomes from advocating for changes to this system. In response, Poverty Action focuses on placing our constituency as leaders in our legislative campaigns, and creating analyses that demonstrate the way that public policy can improve or worsen racial equity. Through our campaigns, we address systemic barriers\u2014including racism, sexism, and xenophobia\u2014to economic security, as well as hold corporations accountable to consumers, families, and workers in Washington. \r\n\r\nRecent budget decisions underscore the need for the legislature to hear from people with low incomes and people of color. For the past four years, legislators have chosen to cut basic health and human services significantly instead of closing corporate tax loopholes that benefit big businesses and banks. This systemic failure caused a dramatic decrease in services for people with low incomes, people with disabilities, seniors, and children. To ensure that lawmakers hear from and are accountable to low-income communities, we provide:\r\n\r\n* Grassroots Organizing and Advocacy Training: \r\nPoverty Action brings community members together to communicate with legislators through one-on-one meetings, Members in Action nights, online action alerts, phone banks, rallies, and lobby days in Olympia. We provide advocacy trainings to assist our constituents in writing to their lawmakers, crafting effective letters to the editor, testifying at hearings, and more. Advocacy trainings also ensure that we are up-to-date on the issues families and workers in Washington face and engaging people in the political progress.\r\n\r\n* Policy Advocacy: \r\nOur legislative agenda both reflects the experiences and perspectives shared in Listening Sessions, and includes an in-depth analysis of the racial equity impact of each issue. Our staff lobbyist forwards our agenda, which includes strong advocacy for basic needs programs in the state budget, consumer protections, and support for families impacted by the criminal justice system. \r\n\r\n* Leadership Development: \r\nPoverty Action has a long history of empowering activists to share their stories with the media and lawmakers through our SPEAK project. We have bolstered our longstanding leadership development efforts in low-income communities and communities of color, and are working to document and disseminate personal stories of people with low incomes from every county in our state. We work with our members to connect their personal stories to systemic issues, share their stories with their communities and the media, and connect these stories to our representatives to improve policies and programs that serve low\u2010income families and ensure corporate accountability.",

In recognition of the intersections of oppression, such as race and class, faced by our membership, we are committed to working with our constituents to address the issues they most care about through a cycle of engagement and advocacy. What begins with sharing their expertise moves to meeting with lawmakers, testifying in Olympia, registering their communities to vote, and participating as an expert in mass media. \r\n\r\nOur overarching goal for 2013-2014 is to ignite a statewide conversation on the intersections of class and race in public policy. Each of our campaigns is built to support this effort. In order to thrive, our state must embrace the fact that poverty does not exist in a vacuum and that economic justice is intrinsically linked to the struggle for racial equity.\r\n\r\nFor our policy work, we will define success as passing strong consumer protections around financial services; restoring funding, in response to deep cuts, to basic safety net services in the state budget; and connecting lawmakers to their most vulnerable constituents. We will know that lawmakers have heard and incorporated our perspectives when they use our racial impact analysis to talk about why they are supporting or opposing specific policies. \r\n\r\nWe will have been successful in building leadership when we hold at least 60 advocacy trainings throughout the state, record and share 10 stories tangibly connected to pressing issues, and bring 200 constituents to Olympia to meet with lawmakers in the coming year. Beyond the impact on legislators, we will also know our trainings are successful when community members move past the silence and shame of poverty to tell their stories about surviving on very low incomes, and proudly step forward even when they do not believe they have an important story to share.", 
    "narrative5": "1) Implementing a Strong Families Framework: Strong Families and Western States Center\r\nIn 2012, we led a coalition of smaller social justice organizations across Puget Sound to create an election season dialogue on economic justice, family preservation, juvenile justice, and reproductive rights. This cross-issue collaboration embodied our commitment to building people of color (POC) led organizational capacity through an electoral advocacy campaign that reached low-propensity voters while challenging dominant narratives about what a family looks like. Together, we created a Voter\u2019s Guide that published candidates\u2019 answers to our questions about our collective priorities. By developing a shared language and framework to hold candidates accountable during the 2012 elections, together we engaged nearly 50,000 first-time, immigrant, POC, and youth voters. Furthermore, this campaign helped our partner organizations develop the tools to run advocacy and electoral organizing campaigns, including list-building, canvassing, and phone banking. Contact: Aimee Santos-Lyons, Western States Center\r\n\r\n2) Exploring Intersections of Race and Class in Policy: Racial Equity Team\r\nFurther expanding on our commitment to developing POC-led organizations in their efforts to engage in electoral organizing, we participate in our state\u2019s Racial Equity Team, a POC-led group of community leaders, activists, and lobbyists working to promote racial equity within the legislative process. With this Team, we are developing and sharing our analysis of the ways that class and race play into policy discussions, as well as serving as a clearinghouse for POC organizations to bring this analysis and messaging to their own members. In our co-facilitation role, we\u2019re helping expand the Team and bringing more voices into policy advocacy. In addition, we bring the wrap-around service mentality of our parent organization in a multi-issue approach to moving the legislature\u2019s culture and priorities.

    "narrative6": "Poverty Action illuminates the relationship between racial and economic justice, and places poverty in a historical context. Two strategies we use are:  \r\n\r\n* Racial Impact Statements\r\nIt is no longer enough to simply say that \u201ccommunities of color are disproportionately affected\u201d by a piece of legislation if we are to deepen the discussion about the intersection of racial justice, economic justice, and public policy. Instead, we must study policy initiatives that would both negatively and positively impact communities of color and then create Racial Impact Statements (RIS) about why those initiatives would have either a worsening or mitigating effect on racial equity. For example, when framing the issues of payday lending we would discuss how a history of bank redlining left many communities of color un- or under-banked and distrusting of banks, which has brought about the aggressive targeting of communities of color by this industry. We would also include the ways in which financial institutions can and should support equity in communities of color. We anticipate creating RIS for our policy priorities with the help of our members, publishing this analysis on our website and in our materials, and working with our coalition partners to use this in their campaigns. We will also use RIS to help build the analysis of lawmakers so they can be more thoughtful and proactive about the legislation they support or oppose.\r\n\r\nJust as the policies and narratives of years past continue to have an incredible impact on low-income communities and communities of color, these communities can have an incredible impact on public policy and dominant narratives using a tool such as Racial Impact Statements. \r\n\r\n* SPEAK (Sharing Personal Experience As Knowledge): \r\nSPEAK is critical in using stories to show the current disparaging narrative of low-income people as false. It instead creates new frameworks that reflect the complexity of poverty and the systemic nature of the oppression. We know that despite their invisibility, oppressions like racism cause poverty, and that poverty perpetuates these oppressions in a well-established cycle. SPEAK interrupts that cycle through by shifting discourse of poverty from an individual frame to a systemic problem that must be addressed through policy. Moreover, by bringing forward people with low incomes as spokespeople, SPEAK changes who is qualified to speak out and be the \u201cexpert.\u201d As part of the SPEAK project, we will hold Listening Sessions across Washington where we will hear powerful stories of how budget cuts and legislative policies are impacting people\u2019s lives. Then we will publish their stories for legislators, community members, and media to connect real experiences with statewide cuts to critical services and lack of consumer protections. \r\n\r\nTogether these approaches underpin our racial and economic justice organizing.

Stonewall Youth is an organization built and sustained by our community for 22 years. We began in 1991 as a series of community meetings of youth and adults to discuss the needs of LGBTQQIA young people in Thurston County. Since then, our capacity and services have evolved with the support and guidance of committed staff, youth leaders, mentors, and funders like the Social Justice Fund. Stonewall Youth holds both direct service support work and social justice organizing at the core of our organization.\r\n\r\n Some of our accomplishments include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Surviving as the oldest queer youth organization in our area, celebrating two decades of existence and uninterrupted weekly support group services for 22 years;\r\n\r\n\u2022 Providing the only resource for many LGBTQQIA youth who live in rural southwest Washington, and providing services to a breadth of LGBTQQIA youth, and the organizations and institutions that serve them, in many counties, with a limited budget/staff; and\r\n\r\n\u2022 Maintaining consistently free, relevant, youth led programs for LGBTQQIA youth.\r\n\r\n\u2022 In 2010 we realized a long-term dream of moving to a larger more accessible space co-located with allied organizations, allowing us to pool resources and better serve our community.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Throughout the past year we have been working towards our organizational goals of increasing the diversity of our leadership, continuing to educate ourselves about adultism, and working to better serve LGBTQQIA youth of color, LGBTQQIA youth with disabilities, and LGBTQQIA youth who experience homelessness. We have expanded our Board of Directors, now 50% youth, to include members with more diverse backgrounds, instituted a Youth Council leadership arm, and worked with partner organiations to better serve target populations.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Our work addresses the isolation and trauma that LGBTQQIA youth face in Thurston County and surrounding rural areas. Today, LGBTQQIA youth are significantly more likely than their peers to experience violence, attempt suicide, and abuse substances. In schoolsthey experience hate crimes, bullying, and are unable to access basic services such as culturally competent teachers, relevant curriculum, and safe bathrooms. These injustices lead to depression, high drop out rates, and serious health issues. Factors such as family rejection contribute to the statistic that over 40% of homeless youth are LGBTQQIA identified. LGBTQQIA youth face barriers to accessing social services such as health care, safe housing, foster care, and experience higher rates of violence in the juvenile justice system. The institutional oppression and micro-aggressions faced by young people who are gender variant, trans, and non-heteronormative causes trauma, isolation, and violence in our communities. Stonewall Youth supports LGBTQQIA individuals and brings communities together in Thurston county and surrounding areas to address these issues and create change.\r\n\r\nAt Stonewall Youth, we build collective power through leadership, structure, programs, community outreach, and collaborations. The organization is comprised of a three-person staff collective, Board of Directors, Youth Council, Speakers\u2019 Bureau, participants and volunteers. Decisions are made through processes involving all aforementioned parties, each of which include youth members. We prioritize sustainability and the success of youth in leadership positions. In 2012, Youth Council formed with the goal of structurally amplifying youth voices. Youth Council currently has two stipend Board Member positions and 7 core members. Last month we held a three-day long retreat with 30 members (two-thirds of which were youth) and did strategic planning to identify and address the root causes of power dynamics, redistribute power, and amplify the voices of youth, people of color, people with disabilities, and marginalized identities within the organization. We believe healing, education, and fun are essential for sustaining collective power. We design support, arts, music, and education programs to promote growth, awareness, and build allyship skills in ourselves and communities. We strive to align ourselves with campaigns and movements and support the work of social justice organizations because we know we are stronger together.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, one active Stonewall Youth participant (age 17) told me they contacted us because they felt alone, and now, in less than one year with Stonewall Youth, are an activist in their community.  As youth age out of our programs, some integrate into ally roles in the organization, some stay in rural areas, and many move to cities.  We support the leadership of youth who create change in their lives, schools, and institutions. We believe the resilience, skills, and collective power we build together manifests in strong and engaged communities members. \r\n",

Our strategies focus on sustainability and collective power. We will continue regular Queer and Trans People of Color community meetings. We will amplify youth voices within our organization through Youth Council, supporting their work with resources, trainings, and collective visioning at our annual retreat. We will sustain Speakers\u2019 Bureau, a group of 10 youth, with one staff coordinator, that facilitate anti-oppression workshops to schools, organizations, and service providers.\r\n\r\nWe will continue weekly Drop In Hours and Peer Support Groups for LGBTQQIA youth, and are collaborating with the Lakes Highschool GSA in starting a Support Group on the Fort Lewis Military Base for LGBTQQIA youth of military families. We are doing outreach in surrounding counties with the hopes of fostering support networks for LGBTQ youth in rural communities. \r\n\r\nWe are collaborating with several organizations in Thurston County to vision and implement harm reduction strategies for reducing homelessness in LGBTQQIA populations. On June 27th we will host a panel with local youth, organizers, government officials, and activists to address the issues that LGBTQQIA youth who are homeless face, and how we can work together towards a healthy and housed community.\r\n\r\nWith our focus on long term goals of building powerful, thriving, and diverse LGBTQQIA communities we may not ever be able to fully measure outcomes. We will assess programs, staff, and volunteers through informal and formal evaluations, focus groups, and surveys. We will know we are on track if we retain youth and other marginalized folks in leadership positions, and are successfully able to integrate new members.  ", 
    "narrative5": "As an organization in a more rural area, collaborations are essential to our work. Stonewall Youth collaborates with several organizations in Thurston County to work towards ending homelessness in LGBTQQIA populations. We have worked for many years with Partners In Prevention Education (PiPE), an organization whose mission is to engage homeless and at-risk youth and adult allies in the elimination of sexual assault and domestic violence as it contributes to homelessness and as it exists in street culture. Together we host an art therapy program, Queer Art Heals Your Heart, and this year opened Saturday Drop In Hours for LGBTQQIA youth who experience homelessness. We have applied for funding for further collaborations with PIPE including mural projects, continued Drop In Programs, and a homeless youth Speakers' Bureau/zine project. We have been collaborating with the Peoples House, an alliance of activists, organizers, social service providers, and interfaith groups working with individuals who experience homelessness and the City of Olympia to open a 24 hour drop in center. Stonewall Youth has participated in consultations to insure inclusivity for LGBTQQIA youth, adults, and families. We have organized trainings and consultations with Community Youth Services, an organization that empowers at-risk youth and their families to meet their goals for safety, stability, belonging and success by providing a continuum of individualized services and advocacy. These folks in addition to LGBTQQIA youth that experience homelessness are participating in our June 27th community panel. Through these collaborations we build a movement to address homelessness that is inclusive and specific to LGBTQQIA populations. \r\n\r\nIntegral to our work is our collaboration with Pizza Klatch, an organization that runs LGBTQQIA Peer Support Groups in nine high schools in Olympia, Tumwater, and Lacey. Stonewall Youth fiscally sponsors Pizza Klatch and staff facilitate Pizza Klatch Groups, train volunteers, and support administrative work. ", 
    "narrative6": "At Stonewall Youth we are prioritizing racial diversity in our staff, Board, and volunteers in order to better reflect the needs of our whole community, better meet the needs of people of color (POC), and provide avenues of leadership for POC youth. Thurston County is a mostly white rural economy with minority race populations facing great marginalization and loss of visibility. We are working to meet the specific needs of LGBTQQIA youth of color, who lack access to services that treat the intersections of all their identities. Most local services are provided in settings lacking a critical race lens or lacking in racially diverse leadership. In an effort to address this intersection we have recently organized a community meeting space for queer trans persons of color. In line with our organizational priorities to increase leadership amongst POC populations, this group was created and staffed by a intern who is a person of color. Typically we limit our programs to youth under 21 but in recognition of the greater community need, combined with the overwhelming lack of local resources for communities of color, we have kept this group open to community members of all ages. Funding struggles limit our ability to strengthen this group and with funding from SJF we can sustain and stabilize this crucial community resource.\r\n\r\nWe strive to balance the responsibilities of an organization populated by both white youth and youth of color.  We challenge the tokenizing of POC youth and staff as we work to increase their visibility, access to power, and self determination by constantly educating ourselves.  In April we received a training on systemic intersections of oppression for 30 youth, staff, and Board members, from the Anti Oppression Training and Resource Alliance (AORTA).   In the past year staff members have attended trainings from the Coalition of Anti-Racist Whites, the Seattle Race Conference, and participated in various communities organizing for racial justice.  This year we sent three participants to the FIERCE (Fabulous Independent Educated Radicals for Community Empowerment) conference for LGBTQQIA youth of color in Chicago.  At Stonewall Activism Summer School and Speakers' Bureau trainings we have hosted workshops from organizers of the Evergreen State College Queer People of Color student group, and local activists and trainers organizing for racial justice.  Speakers' Bureau facilitates community workshops addressing the intersections of racism, classism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and adultism. They provide trainings on how to be an ally to target identity groups, and how to address and interrupt oppression. We will continue to educate ourselves and our community, to participate in a collaborative and holistic movement towards racial justice, and to support leadership of POC at Stonewall Youth. ",

OPAL is the preeminent grassroots environmental justice organization in Portland metro, with long-standing relationships in the community and a track record of successful movement building and organizing. In 2010, after having carried air quality and asthma education and outreach to East Portland communities, OPAL transitioned to a Transit Justice and Health Equity program to respond to the community\u2019s critical needs and priorities. OPAL\u2019s Bus Riders Unite program is a membership-driven campaign to mobilize transit-dependent riders to advocate for equitable investments and opportunities for meaningful public participation decision-making. After more than three years of grassroots community organizing and campaign prioritization, OPAL has built a BRU membership base with a core of committed leaders and approximately 50 dues-paying members, with over 35 organizational allies in the region.

    "narrative3": "TriMet (Portland\u2019s transit authority) is lauded as a national model for progressive transportation, largely due to the region's light-rail (MAX) system, which receives the majority of federal, state and local resources, while core bus service is consistently cut. Rail development has largely benefited more affluent commuters and those fortunate to live near the service. Transit riders that rely predominantly on the bus have been negatively impacted, jeopardizing the health equity of our region. We have a clear two-caste system, with 21st Century rail and 20th Century bus, and with transit-dependent riders unable to keep pace with annual fare hikes.\r\n\r\nDespite recent demographic changes in the region, this power imbalance persists. As part of the FY13 budget, the TriMet board approved an historic fare hike, cut bus service for the fifth straight year and eliminated the Free Rail zone. A majority of all cash/ticket TriMet boardings (56%) are now made by transit-dependent riders, with a disproportionate number of people of color given their relative lack of access to personal automobiles (32% v. 19%). People of color and low-income are also more likely to transfer between lines, meaning longer wait times and more missed connections. Compounding these disparities is an agency that is neither transparent nor accountable to its riders. There are no transit-dependent riders on the TriMet Board (and only one regular rider!), who are appointed by the Governor with no public input, and no meaningful process to engage riders in fundamental and critical decisions.\r\n\r\nOPAL\u2019s strategy to change this unjust dynamic is to institutionalize Bus Riders Unite and build power with transit-dependent riders to influence decision-making. Over the past three years, OPAL has built the BRU membership and social capital through grassroots organizing, education and leadership development. BRU forced TriMet to change their practice so as to allow public comment before making decisions (as opposed to relegating all testimony to the general public comment period at the end of meetings). TriMet\u2019s board and staff are increasingly aware of the need for a greater focus on transit equity, implementing OPAL\u2019s proposal for a standing Transit Equity Committee including transit-dependent riders.\r\n\r\nOPAL\u2019s primary goal is to facilitate and support members to take greater ownership of BRU, with formal membership criteria and leadership structure, subcommittees and priorities, a recruitment, orientation and retention strategy and a grassroots fundraising strategy. Through leadership development, BRU will have a leading role in TriMet's Transit Equity Committee, influencing the decision-making of its Board through public testimony and direct action, and changing the narrative for our region. Members have prioritized campaigns to extend transfer times, improve East Portland bus stops, preserve and expand YouthPass, and protect the rights of immigrants and riders of color subject to fare inspection.",

    "narrative4": "Our first goal for this new project is empowerment through education for transit riders and our immigrant rights partners. Strong anecdotal evidence exists that people of color, immigrants and low-income riders are subject to profiling on transit, resulting in heavy fines, expulsion or even deportation. Public transit is a lifeline for new Oregon families, yet immigrant communities are feeling unsafe on transit, and may be going to great lengths and expense to avoid it. There is sufficient evidence to support these anecdotes: the rate of deportation cases and felony charges for \"theft of service\" have both significantly increased; fare inspectors are paid on quota and are sent on targeted \"fare missions;\" undercover plainclothes officers are being deployed; and automated ticket machines in lower-income areas and areas with higher concentrations of immigrants and people of color break down more frequently, often for hours on end (frustrating riders, who have no choice but to jump on the approaching train without valid fare). This shows a disturbing pattern and practice and a lack of integrity and accountability. Relying on public research and engaging in popular education activities, OPAL and our partners will then be able to develop a coherent demand to correct any injustice and protect our civil liberties. While all transit riders are vulnerable, immigrants (who are not yet citizens) are particularly so, as any violation of civil infractions can trigger deportation or complicate residence applications, regardless of documentation or status. Repeat offense is considered a \"theft of service,\" which can result in expulsion from the system and felony charges, but is also considered a \"Crime of Moral Turpitude\" pursuant to ICE regulations, which is grounds for deportation. We will evaluate our success if we can establish factual patters, if our partners become engaged and if we collectively reach unity of action.", 
    "narrative5": "OPAL is a leading and founding member of Connecting Communities of Oregon, working to repeal statewide prohibition on the use of mandatory inclusionary zoning, an important land use tool to promote mixed-income housing development and housing mobility and opportunity. OPAL's role is to facilitate the coalition, broaden its reach throughout the state, and connect non-traditional partners to fight for housing justice, making the connection between housing, transportation and health outcomes. Through this work, OPAL is also part of another statewide effort, the Racial Equity Report Card coalition, facilitated by the Western States Center, to track and influence legislation with strong racial equity outcomes. OPAL's legislation to repeal the prohibition on inclusive housing is one of the bills being tracked by the Racial Equity Report Card, ensuring that the racial equity impacts of this effort do not go unnoticed. These efforts facilitate an awareness around the intersectionality of our shared work, as we raise awareness of the impacts to both communities of color and low-income communities, and the integration of housing, transportation, economic opportunity and health. Taking these principles from statewide advocacy to on-the-ground organizing, OPAL is also a member of the Aloha Unite coalition, working with the Center for Intercultural Organizing and other organizations in unincorporated Washington County to bring communities of color, immigrants and low-income families into County planning processes to ensure that their voices and priorities are heard and met. OPAL's role is to provide transit justice advocacy along with education on the \"Sustainable Communities\" approach of integrating the housing, transportation, jobs and health equity planning.", 
    "narrative6": "Race, ethnic and class discrimination, along with progressive paternalism, are the root causes of environmental injustice. Environmental health inequities persist due to institutional discrimination, exclusionary policies and practices, and tokenism. OPAL works to dismantle oppressive structures within our organization by intentionally being led by those who are most impacted by environmental injustice. OPAL\u2019s campaign work is driven by people of color and working-class people, our Bus Riders Unite transit justice work is driven by those who are transit-dependent, and all our grassroots organizing intentionally targets low-income families and communities of color in outreach and engagement and leadership opportunities. We strive to have an organization and structure representative of the communities within which we work, and are majority POC-led (though currently the Executive Director is white). Our board is 50% POC, our staff is 60% POC, our core leadership is 60% POC, and our membership is approximately 40% POC. However, we are multi-racial, with an overarching focus on working with low-income people, regardless of race, and as such, attract a lot of poor white members, as well as more privileged white allies. We use that opportunity to educate our members and allies around the history of Civil Rights and environmental justice, and on the importance of racial justice, while adhering to our value that all movements against oppression are united.",

    "cycle_question": "Transit is a lifeline for those without viable alternatives. Low-income people tend to rely on public transit, as do people of color and immigrants who are less likely to have access to personal automobiles than whites. Yet TriMet's current fare inspection system appears set up to entrap low-income riders, immigrants and people of color in the criminal justice system, often with devastating results. Not only are fares at historic levels, forcing transit-dependent riders to make difficult choices between mobility and other basic needs (food, rent, utilities, service, clothes, education, recreation), but automatic ticket machines are frequently broken in low-income communities, encouraging \"fare evasion\" when a missed connection can lead to a loss of employment or opportunity. TriMet's current approach appears to be one of high militancy and public threat, with inspectors working in tandem with local law enforcement and immigration. Individuals may end up with a heavy fine (which they cannot pay), expulsion from the system (which further cuts them off from opportunity), felony charges (which stick with them for life), or even deportation (the ultimate). Transit justice and Civil Rights demand safe, frequent, accessible and affordable public transportation. When public transit is none of these things, yet fare evasion is treated as a felony \"theft of service\" and a \"Crime of Moral Turpitude,\" transit-dependent riders are caught in a vicious cycle, unable to hold those with power accountable. After collecting anecdotal evidence for the better part of the last year, we know the time is now to begin addressing these issues in collaboration with our immigrant rights partners, who have thus fare lacked the capacity to engage. Breaking this cycle through popular education, empowerment and a targeted, concise campaign demand and potential legislative action is the only means to regaining integrity and holding TriMet and the judicial system accountable.",

And it must act as a watchdog against abuses of power.\u201d Monopoly control of the media is a serious threat to democracy. Instead of giving the people information they need to inform their lives, the media bombard us with watered down, biased, censored news, ads and cheap sensationalism.\r\n\r\nAs a progressive community radio station, Thin Air Community Radio is in a unique position to convene the community through dialogue using the public airwaves. Thin Air Radio's goal is to build a strong, listener-supported community radio station that empowers people to make change. KYRS is a catalyst, acting as a clearinghouse for critical discussions and information that address root causes of problems. Every day, our program hosts engage and activate people in parts of six surrounding counties. Whether it\u2019s discussing the hardships undocumented youth face in higher education, the war on drugs and its effects on both the US and Latin America, or teen news contributors covering urban forestry, our radio programs offer in-depth community conversations that insight action and involvement. \r\n\r\nOur programs focus on root causes of problems such as abuses of power, disenfranchisement, discrimination, oppression, environmental degradation, racial and economic disparity. Our local news covered the Spokane Community College panel of Veterans For Peace on our country's habit of paying lip service to war veterans.  Also on our local news, Spokane Neighborhood Action Programs talked about home heating assistance, emergency and transitional housing for the homeless, financial training and the problem of getting information about support options to Spokane's transient population. We\u2019ve covered Spokane's Move to Amend and a panel discussion on Citizens United.  Thin Air Radio recorded and broadcast the Spokane River Forum Conference, which addressed water quality, water quantity, and stewardship issues. Recent topics on InnerTribal Beat include racism in sports mascots, Sherman Alexie, Healthcare in Indian Country. Upcoming topics include: Climate Change and Tribes, Coal Train Pollution, Resistance to Dirty Energy on Tribal Lands.\r\n\r\nThin Air Radio\u2019s public dialogue and locally produced news, views, and culture provide a civic space for under-served populations to tell their stories, educate decision makers and have honest discussions which inspire understanding and positive change.  Our program hosts have dealt with the Violence Against Women Act; families living in exile because of deportation and other aspects of Comprehensive Migrant Justice; the health of local tap water; and art that expresses living with a loved one with Alzheimer's.\r\n\r\nBy stimulating people to talk (and listen) in a public forum, we build community, build understanding, and build collective power.\r\n ",

Rather than merely entertain, our goal is to promote and facilitates communication and collaboration among organizations, encouraging and enabling increased participation from community members. There is no other media outlet in Spokane that better addresses community needs.\r\n\r\nThis year we will produce well over 1,000 hours of local programming dedicated to advancing social justice. This includes our youth and women's issues programs, our cultural, environmental and Arts programs, and our public affairs and commentary programs. Approximately 300 interviews will be conducted with community members and representatives of local non-profits during the grant period.  Six new middle school students will be trained to produce and host a radio program. \r\n\r\nWe will also convene and facilitate a week-long camp for low-income and ethnic minority youth, with a focus on radio broadcasting, production, journalism, and social justice. The result of the camp will be the formation of a weekly radio program produced and hosted by the youth. The youth will gain skills in broadcasting, journalism, interviewing, audio-editing, computer literacy, team work, leadership, communication, and time-management.\r\n\r\nWe evaluate the success of our programs through listener and volunteer feedback. We solicit feedback from listeners on-air, at our annual meeting and open houses. For additional listener feedback, we monitor and process public comment through our website, email, social media, mail, and telephone. Our Listener Advisory Group is also tasked with polling the community and seeking feedback. We also evaluate community support by the number of memberships and level of membership support we receive each year. We anticipate a 3% increase in listenership in 2013. We also gauge this through the support and feedback these programs receive during our on-air fund drives.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Thin Air Radio partners with a variety of progressive non-profits and schools to carry out its mission and build progressive social change. We act a as a platform for discussion, a catalyst for convening change, and a tool for social change organizations to use. This year, with Community Minded TV (CMTV), we are organizing three public forums on the role Humanities-based education and critical thinking play in society.  These interactive forums will be recorded for broadcast on KYRS and CMTV and will encourage independent thought and action. \r\n\r\nWe also work with the Center for Justice, Youth Sustainability Council, the Lands Council, Spokane Riverkeeper, AHANA, and other non-profits to produce public service announcements and record conferences which we then broadcast.  Through one of our former board members, we have established a strong relationship with Eastern Washington University's Chicano Studies program and Chicano student group, which are hosting a Latino cultural radio program for college credit. Students from West Valley City School also get credit for hosting the only middle school program on Spokane radio, and students from Jefferson Elementary produce a kid\u2019s program. We also host interns from the Spokane Falls Community College Audio Technician course, to allow students to earn credit while learning audio recording, editing and production. \r\n\r\nOur collaborations and programs cross issues and demographic lines, and that is the beauty of community radio. As a progressive community radio station, our job is to cover those issues overlooked or censored by the mainstream media. We cover a wide variety of issues every week that appeal to different populations and viewpoints. But the aim, always, is to inspire action rather than entertain and distract as commercial media do.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Multiculturalism, equity and anti-racism are core aspects of our mission. We have over 25 ethnic minority program hosts providing the community with information, conversations and music that broadens appreciation for different cultures, builds understanding and strengthens the community.  We actively recruit people of color and other underrepresented populations to submit program proposals, to serve on the board of directors and on committees. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned elsewhere, we have the only locally produced youth programs, 2 GLBTQA programs, Native American, African American, Asian, Iranian American, Spanish-language and Russian-language programs. We work closely with groups working for peace and justice, such as the Peace and Justice Action League of Spokane,  helping that group get its messages out, including such things as anti-death penalty forums and rallies, May Day immigrant rights marches, and tax-day protests calling for reductions in wasteful Pentagon spending. \r\n\r\n\"The Persian Hour,\" hosted by an Iranian-American, is one of our most popular programs and continues to build community understanding of the rich Iranian culture while challenging the current anti-Middle Eastern sentiment in this country. Our women's issues programs and GLBTQA programs include thoughtful commentary, interviews and issues-oriented discussions that promote understanding, equity, and education. These radio programs are critical because they not only provide experience and training in media for these oppressed populations, but also provide important perspectives rarely heard in other media.\r\n\r\nWe believe the best way to meet the needs of underrepresented populations is to promote them and allow them a voice on the public airwaves.  Vulnerable populations are best able to tell their stories when given a safe, open environment in which to discuss their feelings, dreams and concerns. They feel less alienated from the larger population when they are given the chance to be heard.  Our programs build confidence in the volunteer producers, and teach them cooperation, leadership, civic participation, as well as technical skills in order for them to realize their dreams and work for justice for their communities.\r\n",

MWV is a statewide coalition with 11 member organizations that work on many of these issues and inform how MWV works at the intersections of oppression and identity.  We work to improve the lives of low-income women through organizing and policy change; we also develop the leadership and influence of low-income women in the decision-making processes that affect their lives.\r\n\r\nMWV does this in three main ways: first, we highlight connections between what's on the ballot, and who's in charge, and women's lived experiences; second, we create leadership opportunities and break down barriers to participation in order to shift the balance of power; and third, we mobilize low-income women to win lasting policy changes.\r\n\r\nRecent accomplishments include:\r\n - Campaign for Medicaid expansion in state legislature that, while unsuccessful, engaged thousands across the state, framed the public debate, and set us up for future efforts\r\n - Lasting policy wins including increasing the state minimum wage, expanding the state children's health insurance program, capping payday lending interest rates, and protecting state investment in vital services through the state budget\r\n - More than 17,000 low-income and \"unlikely\" women voters registered\r\n - 89,000 voter guides produced and distributed via mail, tabling, and door-to-door\r\n - Average of 5 contacts made to each unlikely woman voter throughout each election cycle\r\n - Average voter turnout increase from 35% to 60% for low-income women involved with MWV\r\n - Hundreds of volunteers engaged across the state",

    "narrative3": "Montana Women Vote was founded in response to a profound lack of support for and attention to issues facing low-income women demonstrated by elected officials.  We realized that voter turnout rates for low-income women were about 30%, less than half the state average.  This meant that low-income women had little say in electing their representatives, were seen as politically irrelevant, and were shown little accountability by their representatives.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the disenfranchisement of low-income women is both caused by and a perpetuation of deep and structural poverty.  Low-income women don't fail to vote due to apathy; rather, they face structural barriers such as lack of transportation, childcare, or help reading or translating ballots; they lack the information they need to vote; and they don't feel welcome participating in processes that work against them.  In turn, the absence of voices of low-income women allows elected officials to further inequality, create policies that distribute wealth upward, ignore the basic needs of women and families, children, and people of color, and consolidate power in the hands of the privileged.\r\n\r\nMWV works to address this in two ways: by changing policies to address the day-to-day experience of living in poverty, and by organizing low-income women as leaders and policy advocates within existing power structures.  We believe that neither policy change nor leadership development alone will solve the issues of deep, structural poverty - but that these approaches can fundamentally shift the balance of power, leaving low-income women more and more in charge of their own lives and able to identify and implement solutions that work for them and their communities.\r\n\r\nIn this way, too, MWV works to build collective power - by addressing policies and structures that keep people empowered or powerless, and by creating opportunities for individuals, communities, and our constituency across the state to build and exert political power.  For example, in 2012 we worked to register women living in pre-release centers and court-ordered drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities.  By law, people living in these centers are eligible to vote; however, many facility staff were at best misinformed and at worst actively disenfranchising their clients.  We confronted this on two fronts:  first, working center by center to build relationships with staff and clients, provide information, and show up with voter registration forms and information.  Second, we worked with the Secretary of State's office to provide a memo and analysis of the law to facilities in order to prevent future disenfranchisement.  This work helped to shift the balance of power both on a local level - who had power within each pre-release center, for example, and more broadly, by illuminating the rights of women leaving incarceration to vote if they so choose.",

We believe both issues will appear on the 2014 ballot:  Medicaid expansion as a pro-active citizen's initiative, and attacks on voter rights as a legislative referendum.  Therefore, our strategies will include voter registration and mobilization, political education and persuasion, and media work including traditional and social media and storytelling.  Each strategy will be best achieved by deepening existing collaborations and building new relationships with progressive leaders and organizations.  \r\n\r\nMWV has engaged deeply with both issues in the past, including as recently as the 2013 legislative session.  We will build on the campaigns we ran over the last few years, re-engaging constituents, volunteers, and community leaders, and deepening the analysis and education we can provide.  We will continue to prioritize the voices of those most affected, and lift up the connections and intersections between these issues and others (such as access to reproductive health care and disenfranchisement of Native voters).\r\n\r\nMWV works to evaluate and assess all our work to the extent possible.  Our most important test is whether we can measure a concrete difference in the lives of our constituents - winning access to health care for uninsured folks, for example, or lasting policy change.  We also set numerical benchmarks for our organizing efforts, ask our local steering committees and volunteers to provide feedback and critique, and evaluate our campaign work with our coalition partners.\r\n\r\nBecause MWV strives to do our work in a way that not only furthers our goals but is also movement-building, we also assess our successes in being a good ally, building the leadership of those most affected, and framing the public debate with our shared values.

    "narrative6": "MWV began as a white organization without a racial justice frame and has been working for the last seven years on internal anti-racist organizational development, relationship-building with communities of color across the state, and policy and organizing work as an ally.  We believe that economic justice cannot be achieved while ignoring racial justice, human rights, LGBT equality, and reproductive justice, and we see our work and our analysis as intersectional.  We work to highlight both shared impacts and shared values between economic justice work and racial justice, LGBT equality, and reproductive justice.  \r\n\r\nFor example, in 2012 MWV opposed LR-121, an anti-immigrant referendum.  We worked to educate our mostly white constituency about immigrant rights, using our values framework around dignity and opportunity.  We are now engaging around comprehensive immigration reform and are able to refer back to that earlier work as we activate our members.  We are using a national framework that includes a gender lens and is LGBT-inclusive - Keep All Families Together.  We are able to identify for our constituency the similar attacks on dignity, opportunity, and family that immigrants face; we are also able to demonstrate how working as an ally to support immigrant rights builds progressive power and benefits all people.\r\n\r\nIn Montana, a crucial aspect of racial justice work for MWV is working as an ally to American Indian communities.  We continue to prioritize educating our base, and engaging as an active and assertive ally, around sovereignty and issues facing American Indians.  In 2012, we partnered with Western Native Voice to coordinate voter registration efforts.  In the 2013 legislative session, we worked with Western Native Voice on Medicaid expansion, highlighting the impacts on Medicaid expansion on Indian country and lifting up the voices and storied of Native women in media work, legislative hearings, and member outreach.\r\n\r\nWe are proud of the progress of Montana Women Vote, our staff and leaders, and our constituency with regard to moving a racial justice analysis as an ally.  We believe that we must be able to begin with education and move to action in our work as an ally.  We look forward to deepening our work with Western Native Voice, Indian People's Action, and other organizations, coalitions, and leaders of color. ",

    "narrative1": "Montana Women Vote was founded in 2000 to engage, organize, and mobilize low-income women as informed voters, policy advocates, and community leaders.  MWV believes that economic justice issues do not exist in a vacuum - rather, they overlap with and encompass issues of racial justice, LGBT rights, access to health care and basic services, education, reproductive justice, human rights, and environmental justice.  MWV is a statewide coalition with 11 member organizations that work on many of these issues and inform how MWV works at the intersections of oppression and identity.  We work to improve the lives of low-income women through organizing and policy change; we also develop the leadership and influence of low-income women in the decision-making processes that affect their lives.\r\n\r\nMWV does this in three main ways: first, we highlight connections between what's on the ballot, and who's in charge, and women's lived experiences; second, we create leadership opportunities and break down barriers to participation in order to shift the balance of power; and third, we mobilize low-income women to win lasting policy changes.\r\n\r\nRecent accomplishments include:\r\n - Campaign for Medicaid expansion in state legislature that, while unsuccessful, engaged thousands across the state, framed the public debate, and set us up for future efforts\r\n - Lasting policy wins including increasing the state minimum wage, expanding the state children's health insurance program, capping payday lending interest rates, and protecting state investment in vital services through the state budget\r\n - More than 17,000 low-income and \"unlikely\" women voters registered\r\n - 89,000 voter guides produced and distributed via mail, tabling, and door-to-door\r\n - Average of 5 contacts made to each unlikely woman voter throughout each election cycle\r\n - Average voter turnout increase from 35% to 60% for low-income women involved with MWV\r\n - Hundreds of volunteers engaged across the state",

We work to highlight both shared impacts and shared values between economic justice work and racial justice, LGBT equality, and reproductive justice.  \r\n\r\nFor example, in 2012 MWV opposed LR-121, an anti-immigrant referendum.  We worked to educate our mostly white constituency about immigrant rights, using our values framework around dignity and opportunity.  We are now engaging around comprehensive immigration reform and are able to refer back to that earlier work as we activate our members.  We are using a national framework that includes a gender lens and is LGBT-inclusive - Keep All Families Together.  We are able to identify for our constituency the similar attacks on dignity, opportunity, and family that immigrants face; we are also able to demonstrate how working as an ally to support immigrant rights builds progressive power and benefits all people.\r\n\r\nIn Montana, a crucial aspect of racial justice work for MWV is working as an ally to American Indian communities.  We continue to prioritize educating our base, and engaging as an active and assertive ally, around sovereignty and issues facing American Indians.  In 2012, we partnered with Western Native Voice to coordinate voter registration efforts.  In the 2013 legislative session, we worked with Western Native Voice on Medicaid expansion, highlighting the impacts on Medicaid expansion on Indian country and lifting up the voices and storied of Native women in media work, legislative hearings, and member outreach.\r\n\r\nWe are proud of the progress of Montana Women Vote, our staff and leaders, and our constituency with regard to moving a racial justice analysis as an ally.  We believe that we must be able to begin with education and move to action in our work as an ally.  We look forward to deepening our work with Western Native Voice, Indian People's Action, and other organizations, coalitions, and leaders of color. ",

    "narrative1": "Common Cause exists as a vehicle for people to organize on their own behalf, holding power accountable to the public interest. We build collective power to advance and defend the integrity of the democratic process itself, the structural basis for achieving broader justice.\r\n\r\nCommon Cause formed in 1970 to empower ordinary people against a proliferation of well-financed special-interest groups and growing political corruption. It became a leading voice against the Vietnam War and for government accountability in the wake of Watergate. Oregonians formed a state chapter with local membership-driven committees. The chapter operates independently, with its own executive director, board and program, and responsibility for raising its own budget.\r\n\r\nCommon Cause Oregon (CCOR) has been at the forefront of most Oregon democracy reform battles. Recent accomplishments include watchdogging Oregon\u2019s Voting Rights Act compliance, laying groundwork to head off voter suppression and to support more people of color on the Portland City Council, and building a statewide coalition to tackle tough money in politics issues.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, CCOR has focused more on technical expertise than on building leadership and power. However, we seek to return to our roots and rebuild a stronger organizing program. In January, we brought on new executive director, Kate Titus, to lead this work. She directed Oregon Action from 2000-2007, helping build it into a vibrant multi-racial, multi-class organization, and brings two decades experience in community and labor organizing.\r\n\r\nCCOR is a well-run operation, strengthened by relationship to a national organization, which provides stable support in finance and accounting, human resources, and web communications.  We have a smart activist board which plans to expand, a director well-suited to the challenges ahead, an online activist base of 13,000, strong individual financial support, and good partnerships within the broader justice movement. We\u2019ve had limited access to mainstream funding.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Common Cause works on core democracy issues that are at the root of our broader movement struggles for justice. Specifically, we focus on protecting and advancing an open political process with broadly shared participation and power. \r\n\r\nWe focus on the underlying structures of our democracy, because this is the necessary prerequisite for most all our other movement work. Whether we\u2019re working on issues of racial profiling, environmental justice, or tenant rights, we\u2019re simultaneously working to open up the political process, redistribute political power, and force outcomes that serve the broader public interest instead of the interests of the most financially powerful. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about who holds power and who\u2019s marginalized. The workings of the underlying political process matter deeply.\r\n\r\nJust look for example at CAUSA\u2019s recent victory on tuition equity for immigrant students. It would not have been possible without open access to the legislative process, public hearings subject to open meetings law, and changing electoral incentives in a democracy where voters still matter. And yet, compare CAUSA\u2019s 10-year struggle to Nike\u2019s recent orchestration of a multi-million-dollar tax break in a matter of weeks, behind closed doors, and it\u2019s clear that Oregon\u2019s legislative system still functions to advantage those who spend millions of dollars on political contributions and lobbying.\r\n\r\nWhile power and politics is at the root of everything we fight for, democracy reform is understandably a secondary issue for many social justice organizations, even while democracy issues like money in politics profoundly affect their areas of concern. Unless as a movement, we\u2019re going to drop everything else and focus only on our democracy, some groups will continue to lead the way on other important issues, but this makes it difficult for them to maintain sufficient focus and expertise on all the underlying democracy issues that affect their access to political power. CCOR makes democracy reform our first priority, taking the lead when other groups can\u2019t, and supporting other groups to address this issue in relation to their own work.\r\n\r\nCCOR builds collective power on these issues both through direct organizing and by working in partnership with other movement groups. We organize a broad base of public support, engaging people at the legislature and in specific issue campaigns. We also convene and participate in coalitions, providing leadership, research, analysis and support for a collective organizational voice.\r\n\r\nCCOR\u2019s work impacts root causes and underlying power dynamics of social justice work by defending and advancing the political process in which we must operate. This is work we can never fully put to rest, once and for all. However the extent of our success at any point in time shapes the extent of our power on other issues.\r\n",

The challenges ahead for our democracy are larger and more urgent than ever before. We must grow and take on more ambitious campaigns.\r\n\r\nCommon Cause Oregon seeks to expand direct organizing in the coming year, in order to engage more people, build greater collective power, win strategic structural changes, and ultimately defend and advance an open democratic political process with broadly shared participation and power. To that end, several objectives are top priorities:\r\n\r\nLeadership \u2013 Build the leadership necessary for this ambitious work, by expanding the board and developing new working committees.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure \u2013 Build the infrastructure necessary to increase member & public involvement in the work, by establishing fall and spring direct organizing programs staffed by interns.\r\n\r\nMoney in Politics \u2013 Map out and implement the next phase of work on campaign finance reform. This includes our Only People are People (OPP) campaign to reclaim the public right to regulate money and corporate influence in politics through a constitutional amendment. It also includes next steps related to Oregon political contribution limits and Portland voter owned elections. \r\n\r\nFair & Impartial Courts \u2013 Launch a coalition to bring underrepresented voices to the table on judicial issues and head off the ideological politicization of judicial elections and buying of judges in Oregon.\r\n\r\nLines of Political Power \u2013 Begin building leadership and political will for fixing the Oregon redistricting process so that legislators themselves are no longer in charge of redrawing legislative district lines.\r\n\r\nStaff will work with leadership teams for each area of work to develop measurable objectives and to evaluate progress toward these objectives on a monthly basis.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Common Cause Oregon is a member of the Oregon Voice coalition, the \u201cstate civic engagement table\u201d where movement groups coordinate and collaborate to increase political participation and power, particularly for underrepresented constituencies.\r\n\r\nWithin this coalition, CCOR has sometimes played an advisory role on democracy reform issues, contributing research & analysis to support the work of the other groups. For instance, last year, CCOR gathered and analyzed voting data for Oregon Voice, to identify underrepresented populations in Oregon. The purpose was to prepare allies to be able to counter misleading election media hype about voter fraud (aimed at justifying voter suppression policies) with facts showing the need for greater voter participation. CCOR also conducted research for the Portland Urban League on municipal level election methods that could help increase representation of people of color on the Portland City Council.\r\n\r\nAnother coalition CCOR works with, and helped found, is Oregonians for Restoring Constitutional Democracy, a campaign coalition to overturn misguided Supreme Court decisions on corporate rights and money in politics that are severely eroding our democracy. The coalition includes Rural Organizing Project, Main Street Alliance, Move To Amend, Alliance for Democracy, Oregon PeaceWorks, Tax Fairness Oregon, and part of the Occupy movement. Together we passed resolutions in 15 local Oregon communities last year and are now working to pass a resolution at the state legislature. CCOR shares leadership in this very active campaign coalition.\r\n\r\nIn general, CCOR approaches coalition work as a way to build unity and collective power for a broader movement agenda. We assume particular responsibility for helping connect the dots between various movement issues and the underlying systemic issues related to the political process, providing leadership as appropriate, but often supporting the leadership of ally groups in relation to their own priority issues and with their own constituencies.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Common Cause Oregon works on democracy issues that impact a broad 99% constituency. Reflecting state demographics, the organization\u2019s base skews heavily white. Currently, CCOR is a primarily white-led organization and approaches its work from an anti-racist ally framework. \r\n\r\nHowever, even as CCOR approaches the work broadly, building the broadest base of support, we recognize that democracy reform is about power and oppression and that racism is frequently a central driving factor. CCOR works to expose and confront racism and other forms of oppression so often at the heart of political corruption and injustice.\r\n\r\nAs CCOR confronts racism in the political process, the organization generally works with ally groups led by people of color, respecting their leadership with their own communities and core issues. \r\n\r\nFor instance, on Voting Rights Act compliance, CCOR kept Oregon Voice allies informed about the issues at stake, drafting a memo to support groups to better understand and follow the relevant, but wonky issues under debate. \r\n\r\nDuring Oregon\u2019s most recent political redistricting cycle, CCOR played a watchdog role, while supporting people of color led groups to have greater voice in a process that ultimately resulted in the first people of color majority district in the state.\r\n\r\nWhen CCOR worked with the Portland Urban League last year to research election methods that could help increase representation of people of color on the Portland City Council, CCOR shared expertise in election methods, but deferred to the Urban League and  other people of color groups to decide if, when, and how to utilize the information.\r\n\r\nCCOR organizes a big tent, across diverse lines and interests, helping to expose the racism and other forms of oppression corrupting the political process, while developing solidarity among many constituencies and a sense of everyone having a common interest in an open democratic process with shared participation and power.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, CCOR is in the process of diversifying its leadership to better serve its mission. The organization will continue providing white-ally leadership in alliance with groups led by people of color, and in this way play a valuable role in building broad majority support for democracy reform. However, at the same time, the organization will be more versatile and able to do more direct organizing on racial justice issues, when its own internal leadership is more multi-racial. The CCOR board recently undertook a self-assessment to identify leadership gaps on the board, and has prioritized filling race and age gaps on the board and in other core organizational leadership in the coming year. A grant from SJF would support this work.\r\n",

NCBI envisions a community where the innate value of each person is respected, where members share a commitment to correct injustice, and where all people have the opportunity to thrive without risk of violence or oppression.\r\n\r\nThere are three pillars of NCBI\u2019s work: 1) Youth Development: engaging youth as social justice leaders; 2) Community Development: building community cohesion; and 3) Organizational Development: correcting systemic inequalities.  NCBI Missoula was established in 1998 in response to increasing incidents of racism and homophobia.\r\n\r\nNCBI is a multi-issue organization; rather than focusing exclusively on empowering women, or eradicating religious intolerance, we recognize the intersections between all forms of oppression. To end one, we must tackle them all. Having said that, over the years NCBI has responded to specific community needs with issue-based programs. \r\n\r\nNCBI is a recognized leader throughout the state, providing violence prevention, prejudice reduction and leadership development training across Montana.  For example, NCBI facilitates and is the lead trainer for the Montana Safe Schools Coalition; is Montana\u2019s lead contact with the National GSA Network, providing training and technical assistance to schools and organizations supporting queer youth throughout the state; and provides ongoing training and support to the YWCA of Missoula\u2019s Racial Justice Initiative. NCBI\u2019s school-based work has grown tremendously in recent years; each year, we provide over 2,000 students and hundreds of educators and administrators with tools and skills to prevent violence, reduce prejudice, and create safer, more inclusive schools and communities where everyone can learn and thrive.\r\n",

Last year, during an NCBI prejudice-reduction workshop at a Montana university, a white student remarked, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what the Indians are complaining about. What happened was a long, long time ago. They lost. We won. Get over it.\u201d This sentiment is not uncommon, and reflects a gap in knowledge, history and context between Montana\u2019s indigenous and settler communities.   Just last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center called attention to the rise of \u201cWhite Nationalist Think Tank\u201d organizations in the Flathead region: http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2013/05/16/npi-think-tank-is-latest-racist-outfit-to-move-to-nw-montana/#more-10644.  \r\n\r\nAt a Joint Board of Control meeting in St. Ignatius last week, just last week, a white woman distributed a racist flyers  titled \u201cFlathead Reservation Myths and Facts\u201d to attendees. Including statements such as \u201cThe word Racism can be used as a slang term to instill, or claim, that there is racial prejudice or guilt on innocent American citizens that only seek fair treatment,\u201d the flyer dismissed the existence of historic and ongoing oppression of indigenous people, denied tribal sovereignty, and otherwise sought to undermine and minimize indigenous claims for justice.  \r\n\r\nRoot Causes:  While the work of white supremacist organizations may be \u201cfringe,\u201d misinformation and prejudice toward Native people is widespread.  On the Flathead Indian Reservation, non-Native people outnumber Native Americans by over 2-to-1. It is critical to engage white allies who understand the way racism is operating in themselves and their community and will take leadership to interrupt prejudice and correct systemic inequality. \r\n\r\nBuilding Collective Power / Changing Root Causes: \r\nThe FRHRC and NCBI are partnering to mobilize white allies who will partner with tribal members on the Flathead reservation to interrupt racism. \r\n\r\nThe EWR Course provides participants opportunities to examine their relationship to racism, exploring ways whiteness operates on individual, interpersonal, cultural and institutional levels. This course prepares community members to continue their own life-long learning with regard to deconstructing white dominance while developing the tools to be leaders in empowering others to do the same. At the end of the 8-weeks, participants will develop a personalized action plan to advance racial justice in the Flathead Valley. \r\n",

    "narrative5": "Flathead Reservation Human Rights Coalition: The FRHRC was formed in 1990 to diminish conflict, enhance cooperation, and to promote the multi-cultural nature of the region.  NCBI has partnered with FRHRC over the last ten years to provide prejudice reduction trainings on the Flathead reservation. In the last year, NCBI facilitated two Building Inclusive Schools and Communities workshops in Ronan aimed at giving educators, administrators and community members the tools to build safer and more inclusive schools and communities. The workshops were attended by more than 50 members of the region\u2019s faith, business, human services and education communities. The EWR course will build on this foundational work.\r\n\r\nYWCA of Missoula:  The YWCA of Missoula is a human services and human rights organization that provides services and advocacy for women and their children.  In 2004, the YWCA of Missoula launched a Racial Justice initiative. NCBI Missoula partnered with the YWCA, facilitating a community-wide needs assessment and program development process, resulting in the production of an award-winning public-service campaign engaging white people to be racial justice activists. NCBI Missoula continues to facilitate The YWCA of Missoula\u2019s Racial Justice Task Force. \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "All NCBI programs reflect our core purpose to eliminate inequality, and our commitment to diversity is reflected in the diversity of our staff and board (as described above). As an ally organization, NCBI advances and wherever possible follows the leadership of people of color and other marginalized groups.  Leaders from these constituencies are actively engaged in identifying the needs of their communities, while utilizing NCBI principles and skills as a resource to meet those needs.  \r\n\r\nNCBI Missoula\u2019s core purpose is to create environments where every person has the opportunity to thrive without risk of violence or oppression. The following outcomes are requisite to achieving that goal:\r\n\u2022\tIndividuals think critically regarding the existence and impacts of oppression on self and society.  Community members must understand how systemic oppression operates on individual, interpersonal and institutional levels; recognize our own biases and prejudices and how they affect others; and comprehend the effects of internalized oppression.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCommunity members seek intergroup collaboration. This includes creating opportunities to teach and learn across group lines in the places where people live, work, learn, and play.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPeople utilize tools to interrupt oppression. Interrupting oppression includes shifting individual prejudicial attitudes and societal beliefs, stopping harmful behaviors, and transforming oppressive institutions. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tPeople who have been marginalized become empowered. Empowerment remains critical for two reasons: 1) People cannot thrive when they have internalized self-limiting beliefs, and 2) those targeted by oppression are best situated to accurately identify the oppression and to design effective interventions to create a more just society. \r\n\r\nPersistent inequality and oppression based on race, class, gender, sexual orientation, faith, age, ability, place of birth, and other factors result in the denial of the basic human rights of dignity, safety, and justice.  The continuation of systemic oppression damages us all. When some benefit at the expense of others, all of our humanity is compromised.  \r\n\r\nInterrupting oppression requires empowering and mobilizing those targeted by oppression as well as their allies. The most effective social movements center the voices of those most directly impacted by oppression while at the same time engaging allies as key collaborators to achieve positive social change.  \r\n\r\nNCBI Missoula serves the state of Montana, with a focus on empowering those individuals targeted by prejudice and mistreatment. To accomplish its mission, NCBI has developed a leadership development program and comprehensive course curriculum to reduce prejudice, prevent violence, and resolve conflict. Since we began, over 25,000 participants have received support and leadership development, learning skills to interrupt oppression, prevent violence, and resolve conflict, as well as developing strategies for building just systems. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "The interconnected problems, needs, and issues that our work addresses include, but are not necessarily limited to: poverty, hunger, literacy, language proficiency, immigration status, racism, classism, and the holistic, thoughtful integration of immigrant communities into the larger multi-cultural society. The root causes of these issues are structural, interconnected, and all ultimately products of the United States' failed immigration systems and policies. \r\n\r\nMany of our program participants are undocumented or living in mixed-status families. Living life as an undocumented immigrant in any community is incredibly challenging due to the social, economic, legal, and cultural barriers that immigrants encounter on a daily basis.   The challenges that Latino immigrants face to prosperity and integration in the geographical areas we serve are particularly sizable and unique. \r\n\r\nThe physical geography, transportation infrastructure, and (until very recently) lack of access to driver's licenses for the Latino immigrant families that we serve, creates an environment where many families are isolated from each other.  The community gardens and classrooms where our Cambios micro-development program takes place provide the physical environment and cultural opportunity  for members of the Latino immigrant community to get to know each other better, lend one another support, teach each other, and build a strong sense of community amongst themselves, thereby building collective power. Another pervasive barrier that prevents Latino immigrant families from connecting with one another are the types of jobs, and number of jobs, that immigrants are forced to take. Most individuals that we work with have jobs that pay at or below minimum wage. Because of these low wages, they are then forced to take second jobs, leaving them with essentially no leisure time. Our programs--our community gardens program in particular, build collective power and act as community organizing agents for the diverse, yet stratified Latino immigrant community in Lane County.\r\n\r\nAs the Latino immigrants that participate in our programs build collective power with one another, they individually begin to develop the capacity to take more direct control over their own lives, become leaders in their local communities in whatever capacity that may be, improve their physical and mental health, and strengthen their relationships with their children and other family members. While we do not feel that our work necessarily changes the root causes of the problems that we attempt to alleviate, we do feel that our work helps to make these problems less powerful and less controlling over the lives of the Latino immigrant families that we work with. These problems become less daunting and more manageable for our program participants as they acquire new skills in our garden and business programs and connect with other Latino immigrant families that are enduring similar struggles, realizing that they are not alone.",

We engage in these coalitions and partnerships in an effort to build a more unified food justice and social movement, and collective power amongst the many players and organizations throughout Lane County. \r\n\r\nOur organization plays a valuable role within a local coalition called the Lane County Network for Immigrant Integration (LCNII). Huerto is one of approximately thirty member organizations that work with the Lane County Network for Immigrant Integration. Member organizations and individuals represent local businesses, educational institutions, local governments, law enforcement, social service organizations, faith-based institutions, and non-profits. The network\u2019s main principles include committing to inclusion and integration, recognizing the contributions of all immigrants to our society, supporting immigrant families, promoting respect and non-discrimination, affirming a common sense approach to public safety and community partnerships, and advancing humane and just national comprehensive immigration reform. As part of our work with the LCNII, we help to plan ongoing community conversations' between the Latino immigrant community and the various institutions, governments, and agencies that serve. At these community conversations, service providers and immigrants have the opportunity to get to know and build trust with one another through facilitated, bi-lingual forums and activities.  The focus of these conversations is on: transportation, education, health care and civic engagement.\r\n\r\nWe have also worked closely with University of Oregon Planning, Public Policy, and Management Professor Gerardo Sandoval to support his Latino public participation community research project. Our organization collaborated with him and Dr. James Rojas, a planning and transportation expert who works with Latinos to build community awareness of issues surrounding planning and changes in their communities, to host interactive community planning workshops with Huerto participants.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Huerto de la Familia's interconnected commitments to racial, economic, and environmental justice, stem from the roots of our organization, and are reflected in our mission statement, which is to offer Latino immigrant families a place to connect with their roots and the earth by growing their own food while becoming more economically self-sufficient and better integrated into the greater community. Our dedication to racial justice, economic justice, and environmental justice is reflected by our programs, by the demographics of the individuals that both lead our organization (staff and board of directors) and participate in our programs, and by the objectives and diverse compositions of the collaborative partnerships that we are proud members of. \r\n\r\nDue to anti-immigrant sentiments, fear and ignorance, and racism and classism, many Latino immigrants in our community, feel that their culture, language, and heritage, is not welcomed by the larger multicultural society. At the same time, these immigrants also, over time, see and experience cultural assimilation--as opposed to cultural integration--as a tool for survival. When cultural assimilation (as opposed to cultural integration) becomes a tool for survival, many immigrants begin to lose their culture. For example, we hear the notion of 'losing culture' or 'lost culture' reflected in the testimonies of immigrant parents who garden with Huerto from Mexico and Central America whose U.S.-born children are resistant to speak Spanish with them. We also hear families talk about how they have stopped practicing certain cultural traditions. We also witness how severely Latino immigrant families' struggle to merely spend time together and maintain their strength and culture as a family when both parents, and often times the children as well, are all working several jobs with long hours. \r\n\r\nOur community gardens and micro-development program provide the space and opportunity for the entire family unit to feel accepted, safe, and empowered as they connect with some of their deepest cultural roots which lie in food and agriculture. We are working towards racial justice by helping our families maintain their unique racial and cultural identities and by helping them realize that their culture is something to be celebrated and not suppressed. We also support environmental and economic justice by giving low-income families who do not have access to food stamps or other types of food assistance the opportunity to grow their own organic foods. We view this work as both environmental and economic justice as we are showing the families we work with that growing and eating organic produce is not reserved for the wealthy.  Growing their own food helps them to learn about the benefits of growing and eating organic food, improving their diets, relieving stress and improving mental health, and saving money on grocery bills.

Our founders created APCC to serve as a cultural crossroads, representing all 47 Asia Pacific cultures, to promote cultural competence and build bridges between communities. Over the years we have hosted small and large cultural events open to the public to help teach about our culture, welcoming people of all ethnicities and backgrounds to come and learn about and share in the Asia Pacific experience and help promote understanding of our heritage. These events are also an opportunity for the Asian and Pacific Islander groups to share with the community their pride in their heritage. The public and even Senators, Representatives, Mayors and other government officials attend our events to learn more about our people.\r\nWe serve the community with these events and in a variety of other ways. Our youth programs include our Promised Leaders of Tomorrow Youth Program for highly at-risk Asia Pacific Youth and the Tautua Youth Group. We have the Asia Pacific Cultural Treasure Trunks Project, in which we teach about diversity and teach lessons about the Asia Pacific cultures to K-12 students, teachers, and school administrators. We support local Asian and Pacific Islander community organizations by promoting their activities and sharing resources. Last year our biggest accomplishment was our move from a small 4-room office to taking over a more than 8,000 square-foot building, formerly known as South Park Community Center.

In Washington State there are now more than 640,000 people (or 10% of the population) who are Asian or Pacific Islander \u2013 a 50% increase in only 10 years!  This growing diversity has brought challenges as racial strife and misunderstanding occur, and at the same time opportunities for everyone to learn from and learn about the Asia Pacific culture.\r\nOne of the root causes of racial tension is lack of interaction with and lack of understanding of the people of the Asia Pacific culture. There are those who know very little about our culture or only know stereotypes, and they make assumptions without trying to get more information or without learning more about our values, our traditions, our history, or our heritage. For example the Asia Pacific cultures themselves are extremely diverse and many people do not realize or appreciate that there are characteristics of these cultures that are quite dissimilar. Yet often people mistakenly lump together Asians or Polynesians as one homogenous group of people. APCC is here to try to break down these barriers, build bridges between people, and create an atmosphere of cooperation and understanding by teaching about our culture and providing opportunities for people to experience and interact with the Asia Pacific people.\r\nWe build collective power by bringing together and representing all 47 Asian and Pacific Island cultures.  We try to give support and a sense of belonging to all Asia Pacific people in our community and give them opportunities to be engaged in all of APCC\u2019s events and activities. The different groups have access to APCC and our leaders and we welcome and encourage all people who have ideas to help promote the culture of the Asia Pacific people.\r\nAs we move into a more dynamic multicultural society, APCC strives to address diversity issues and cultural competence through educating the public about the Asia Pacific culture and by providing events and programs that allow people to experience first-hand the heritage, the honor and pride, of the Asia Pacific people. When everyone learns more about diversity, about the different cultures that make up our society, the better we can understand each other, respect each other, and work with each other.\r\n",

These opportunities they sometimes do not have or becomes less emphasized in efforts to become more assimilated to what they view as \u201cAmericanized\u201d. We provide our youth leadership training and other ways to demonstrate their pride in their heritage such as with our Tautua Youth Group, workshops, and cultural activities. Additionally we help our at-risk youth and their families who struggle to navigate through the educational system in order to best help their child finish high school. Often these youth also have legal issues and other problems that they cannot overcome due to language and cultural barriers, so they turn to us for assistance.\r\nWe also advocate through our partnerships and active participation with other Asia Pacific community organizations and through our networks and coalitions to further support the Asia Pacific people.

    "narrative1": "DisAbility Rights Idaho (DRI), Idaho's Protection and Advocacy system, is a private non-profit funded mainly through federal formula grants.  Our mission is to help people with disabilities protect their legal and human rights through free advocacy and legal services.  Our strategies are teaching and organizing people with disabilities to advocate for themselves, supporting self-determination, independence, dignity, and choice, while also providing individual and systemic advocacy and legal representation when self-advocacy is not enough.  Since 1977, DRI has worked with people with disabilities to change public policy allowing people with disabilities access to mainstream education, move out of large public institutions into the community setting of their choice, protect the rights of parents with disabilities (a model for other states recently cited in a report by the President\u2019s National Council on Disabilities), prohibit the involuntary sterilization of adults and children with disabilities, and other legal work on an individual basis helping people with disabilities address denials of services or benefits, disability discrimination, denials of access to public education, and more.  Much of our work focuses on collaborating with other organizations in educating people with disabilities and allies on how to advocate for themselves, including training on how to speak to legislators, the public policy process, and direct self-advocacy strategies.  DRI also helps people with disabilities who are homeless or at risk of homelessness obtain Social Security Disability benefits they otherwise are unable to access, and use those benefits to secure housing.    Another program is the work incentives program, helping people with disabilities get accurate information on their benefits while helping them learn to navigate the employment services network to obtain employment.  Beneficiaries are taught how to advocate for themselves when dealing with Social Security and other government agencies.  DRI provides its services free of charge for both legal and advocacy services.",

    "narrative3": "DRI collaborates with the Idaho Homeless Coalition and other organizations that provide assistance to Idahoans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Estimates of Idaho\u2019s homeless population in 2013 is 1,781 men, women and children ( we believe this number is greatly underestimated due to the methodology \u2013 counting how many people access Idaho\u2019s shelters at one given point in time during the fiscal year). Many of these individuals have disabilities that prevent them from obtaining education, training or employment, or accessing social services that can help them get food, shelter and medical care. Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income, along with Medicare and Medicaid, were established to provide safety nets to people with disabilities who were unable to work for at least 1 year due to their disability. People who are homeless are often unable to access these benefits due to their disability, inability to access medical care and/or get medical documentation of their disability due to their homelessness and frequent relocation. If they have been able to get disability benefits, they often lose them once they lose access to a bank account and physical address. If homeless people with disabilities are lucky enough to have found a way to get and keep their benefits, they are often discouraged by social services, organizations, well meaning friends, and others, from finding employment for fear of losing their hard won benefits, creating a cycle of dependency on public benefits and placing them at increased risk homelessness will re-occur. These issues are addressed by the SOAR Advocate who assists people with disabilities to obtain their disability benefits, access medical care and records, and provides information/education on self-advocacy, including referrals other agencies, to stabilize the person\u2019s/family\u2019s home situation. Once the person's housing is stabilized, DRI\u2019s community work incentives coordinator (CWIC) provides information, planning and assistance on how Social Security work incentives can be used to protect disability benefits and medical coverage until the person can work at a level that provides independence and stability. DRI's certified CWIC, one of only 2 actively working in Idaho, provides detailed benefits counseling and information, working with the client to access training and rehabilitation to get back to work in the employment field of their choice. The SOAR and WIPA programs together create a continuum of assistance in self-advocacy that helps people with disabilities who are homeless access necessary income and medical care to stabilize their situation for the long term instead of a temporary fix that ensures they continue to live in poverty. People with disabilities are empowered to achieve independence, and advocate for themselves while keeping necessary services in place to ensure they do not return to homelessness.",

    "narrative4": "Our overall goal is to help people with disabilities who are homeless develop a long term solution to homelessness, as well as providing the tools and access to employment services to address chronic poverty experienced by many people with disabilities.  The first step is to hire one full time advocate and one half time community work incentives coordinator to make up for the staffing shortage DRI has had over the past 2 years due to budget cuts and delays in funding by Congress' tardiness in passing continuing resolutions/budgets for government funded services.  Both staff will have to receive significant training on disability language and etiquette, diversity training, and training in the respective programs.  Once the training and certifications are complete, the new hires will undergo a period of on the job training, shadowing experienced staff on outreach and education campaigns, eventually obtaining their own caseloads.  Extensive outreach and collaboration with appropriate organizations will be necessary (Idaho Homeless Coalition, Idaho Department of Health & Welfare, Social Security Administration, etc. - see below), as well as outreach into Idaho's underserved communities in rural areas, the Latino community, Refugee communities, and the Native American reservation lands.  Data will be tracked using DRI's two databases (DAD for SOAR, and ETO for WIPA) to determine whether objectives are being met, as well as the client demographics to ensure outreach is effective in reaching Idaho's unserved or underserved populations.  Outcomes will be tracked long term to evaluate whether we are getting clients off the streets and into stable living environments, as well as whether they are able to be gainfully employed.  Data will be reported to our federal funding agencies as well as to SJF in our final report.", 
    "narrative5": "DRI is a lead organization of the Consortium of Idahoans with Disabilities (CID), a coalition of 25+ organizations who are led by and/or work with people with disabilities throughout the state.  In partnership with CID, DRI has  introduced public policies such as moving people with disabilities out of state institutions into the community of their choice, prohibiting the involuntary sterilization of adults and children with disabilities without due process of law, helped mobilize hundreds of people with disabilities to testify to the Idaho Legislature against drastic Medicaid cuts, and, this past year, requiring people who are seeking to be guardians or conservators of people with disabilities to undergo criminal and financial background checks to reduce the abuse and financial exploitation of people with disabilities.  DRI also collaborates with the Idaho Self-Advocates Leadership Network (SALN), an organization run by, and for, adults with developmental disabilities.  SALN now has 4 chapters around the state, and will soon be adding a 5th.  DRI works with SALN to promote awareness about adults with developmental disabilities, serves in an advisory capacity on SALN\u2019s Board of Directors, provides support to self-advocates at SALN\u2019s Leadership Conference (all presenters at the conference must be self-advocates \u2013 people with disabilities), and recently, collaborated with SALN, the Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities and Idaho Legal Aid Services to apply for a grant to address domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking of people with disabilities (pending).  Work with both of these organizations provides an opportunity to empower people with disabilities to organize and speak out about public policy issues that impact their lives, inform DisAbility Rights Idaho and public policy makers about the priorities of people with disabilities, and direct our work in responding to the needs of the disability community in challenging abuse, exploitation, and discrimination in Idaho.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "DRI is historically a white-led organization, reflecting the demographics of Idaho (83.6% white per 2011 U.S. Census figures; Idaho\u2019s next largest ethnic population is Hispanic/Latinos at 11.5%).  However, this is changing.  DisAbility Rights Idaho is building the diversity of its staff (2 Latinas; 2 LGBTQ folks; some low income; many over age 55; both rural and urban staff, etc.).  DRI's Board is now 31% people of color.  People of color are also obtaining positions of leadership \u2013 DRI\u2019s Advocacy Director is Latina, and the incoming Board President is an African American woman.  DRI\u2019s Advocacy Director is heavily involved in social justice and racial issues, and often represents DRI in collaborations with reproductive, racial and social justice organizations in Idaho and throughout the Pacific Northwest.  \r\n\r\nDRI is also moving forward in addressing disability issues within the LGBTQ community.  DRI Senior Advocate, Mel Leviton, recently presented at a national LGBTQ Conference in Atlanta, GA, on a panel discussing the intersection of disability and sexuality in the LGBTQ community (sexuality and disability are rarely discussed, and gay sex and disability is NEVER discussed!)  There were over 6,500 attendees at the conference, and the discussion was well received.  It is hoped that this topic will be addressed at disability focused conferences in the future.  \r\n\r\nAbleism (discrimination based on disability), racism, economic injustice, homophobia, and other forms of oppression all intersect.  People with disabilities can be from any race or ethnicity, gay or straight, rich or poor, although most often live in poverty.  People with disabilities are often oppressed within these groups, being a minority within a minority, in which oppression and discrimination are compounded.  They are often the last to get hired, have the poorest economic outcomes and least access to social safety nets, are denied basic human rights outlawed decades ago for other populations, and are denied basic human dignity and decision making power over their own bodies.  DRI works with organizations in Idaho to educate people on the intersectionality of disability and race, disability and sexuality, and disability and economic rights. Much of our outreach focuses on Idaho's communities of color, which typically have a higher incidence of disability than the white population in Idaho, and the least access to  services either due to language barriers, or due to the mistrust of \"white\" social services.  During the past several years, DRI's assistance has increased in Idaho's Hispanic/Latino Communities, Refugee communities and Native American communities, as well as collaborating with organizations led by people of color, such as public policy and reproductive justice work with the Women of Color Alliance, and providing voters rights training to the Idaho Community Action Network, as well as collaborating with coalitions, including ICAN, on Medicaid issues.

Our mission is to develop systems for food sovereignty and create racial and economic justice. We believe healthy food and sustainable and just food systems are our human right. HUG is working to create a neighborhood-based model unique to our community, with the potential for replication across Tacoma.\r\n\r\nHUG was created in late 2009. With inspiration from Oakland\u2019s Peoples Grocery and Milwaukee\u2019s Growing Power, seasoned organizer Dean Jackson set out to create a community-based project to grow food and to examine and shift power in their neighborhood.  HUG started to formally take its shape in 2010 with our first grant from Social Justice Fund.  In 2011 we began our children's programs with Al Davies Boys & Girls Club!  By the fall of 2012 we had solidified a Leadership Team rooted in liberation and intersectional approaches to social justice. \r\n\r\nFood is universal! Its production offers engaging ways for communities to participate in civic action across the multiple identities we hold. Though managing food gardens may appear to be apolitical, urban farming is a vibrant tool that builds community.  It can shift the power that comes with controlling food supplies back into the hands of the people.  Through building local food justice systems we model the future we want to see. What started as a backyard garden project has grown into seven sites currently feeding 8 households.  We grow on a total of 10,500 square feet of land donated by home owners in the neighborhood.  As of this grant deadline, we have shared 50 pounds of pac choi, 18 pounds of radish, and 65 bags of greens for community consumption.  \r\n\r\nHUG is proud of what we have accomplished as a mostly volunteer and very small budget organization!\r\n",

There is an urgent need for poor and POC communities to organize collectively in creating our own food supply and amassing land to do so.  We can build shared power this way by both providing food and taking advantage of the organizing opportunities growing food in community offers. We are privileged to live in one of the most fertile parts of this world and do not underestimate the power created by owning our food supply.\r\n\r\nOn the Hilltop we are lucky to still have large residential land parcels and wide parking strips.  We work with homeowners to develop these unused portions of their property into food gardens.  This year we are excited to implement HUG Grub - an experiment in sharing the harvest using barter like structures.  \r\n\r\nHunger is the Symptom\r\nMany of us are familiar with the staggering hunger statistics.  1 in 5 households across Washington state reported they didn\u2019t have enough money to buy the food they needed in 2009.  Households with children are at almost double the rate of food insecurity than households without children.  While food charity models seek to address the issue of hunger, HUG views the hunger cirsis as one of the symptoms of economic poverty, resource hoarding, and inequitable wealth distribution.  We're working to address these root issues by building a neighborhood-based food system that is fresh, clean, economically accessible to poor folks, and sustainable in the community.\r\n\r\nNothing About Us Without Us\r\nRight now Tacoma is seeing a local food renaissance.  The community garden program has been expanded and people are talking about growing food in ways the city has not seen in current years.  In this excitement, there is a noticeable lack of a power analysis about structural oppression.  To be expected, this means that the leadership and framing remains largely vested in white, middle class culture that focuses on charity systems and upholds race and class privilege.\r\n\r\nHUG is the only food organization in Tacoma working through the lens of sovereignty and racial/economic justice.  We are the only organization working in our very conservative town to build the power of poor people and POC in the local food movement.  Our Leadership Team speaks on panels, at schools, and to church groups.  We consistently encounter entrenched food charity model thinking. Our presence always invites those in attendance to think beyond charity towards justice and sovereignty.  While it\u2019s an important strategy to be involved in the local food movement, we are also very conscious about our capacity and prioritizing efforts where change is most probable.\r\n",

We'e now seeking your help in order to build the following 2013 focus areas:  \r\n\r\nSharing-based Distribution Model/Farm Readiness\r\nThis year we're testing out a new distribution model we're calling HUG Grub.  It's based in barter-like principles of sharing without the exchange of money.  Neighbors who are hosting HUG gardens receive all of the produce they can eat.  Other neighbors can pick up food at predetermined weekend hours and in return agree to share something with someone in the community.  Sharing can look like many different things, including spending time in HUG gardens, reading a story to your child, or helping your neighbor fix a leaky faucet.  While HUG is not facilitating these transactions, we'll be keeping track of what neighbors agree to share in community.  We seek to learn from this model and grow distribution methods based on what's realistic for the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe're prioritizing building infrastructure at The Farm - our 6,300 square foot land - to create income production in 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\nSustainability  \r\n1.  Organizational structure - Last year we solidified our Leadership Team and four Committees to move from Dean's organization to a community-led organization.  This year we're continuing to build leadership and have greater transparency about ways that neighbors can become involved.\r\n2.  Community Engagement - We've focused our outreach efforts in a four block area we call \"The HUG Zone\".  There are several ways we invite neighbors to get involved. (see below) \r\n3. Resource Development - A year-long effort is underway to build our private donor base, focusing on monthly donors.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Last year we began a relationship with School of the Arts Tacoma (SOTA).  This year we're working with two senior projects to grow food at The Farm for a Community Meal.  We're working with youth to teach basic food production skills and introduce them to concepts of food sovereignty. \r\n\r\nWe're continuing our work with WSU Pierce County Master Gardeners (PCMG). Our partnership affords us volunteers for community program and donated plant materials.  HUG is also quite excited about the deepening partnership Al Davies Boys and Girls Club. One BGC staff observed that our sessions provide balance to the club. We fill a niche through offering an explicitly justice based program that incorporates nature exploration, art and science, and nutrition.  HUG creates opportunities for kids to actualize the BGC \u201cKids at Hope\u201d philosophy. Al Davies has no other similar programming to HUG.  Because we\u2019re partnering with established organizations we\u2019ll see increased leveraging opportunities, structural \u201clegitimacy\u201d and decreased financial input from HUG.  For both of these relationships HUG is transparent and clear about our commitment to creating racial and economic justice. We have every expectation that as we grow, our capacity to model this will increase our impact on these organizations.\r\n\r\nNew this year, we're working with a startup barter project called Fair Tradin'.  They'll be bringing their barter event to our August Community Potlucks.  In addition, we are working together for a series of food preservation sessions.  This collaboration is newly formed, but comes from years of conversation between HUG's Director and Fair Tradin's founder, Hal Meng.  Im May we co-presented at the Community Garden Summit and were quite pleased with the holistic nature of the message we gave as a team.  The barter philosophy combined with HUG's intersectional anti-oppression lens looks to be a strong collaboration in the making.", 
    "narrative6": "Food independence models a path to social justice that the average person can relate to. Gardens provide an opportunity to transform scarcity modes of thinking to those of abundance. This is a powerful gift to bring to our neighbors. We are making social justice accessible to folks who have never heard of it (or who thinks it's \"those people\").  We target our efforts for the working-class, low-income, and POC neighborhood we operate in.  Our success will be ensured by our relevancy and commitment to these communities.\r\n\r\nOur leadership team is predominantly mixed-race and people of color and half live on the Hilltop.  All have demonstrated a commitment to racial & economic justice through prior work, a willingness to learn, and the understanding that this is life-long work..  HUG is founded by an out queer, black, low-income, trans/genderqueer person with a history of social justice work in the Pacific Northwest.  This is important because of the strong conservative lens that runs through even progressive-minded community in Tacoma.  HUG does not seek to put the responsibility of drawing connections to systems of oppression on our Director.  The reality is that Dean's out and upfront style of leadership creates community openings that would not otherwise exist.\r\n\r\nThose in leadership positions must understand systemic oppression and how it manifests in daily interactions. Through this analysis, our work is guided to authentically address inequity and create positive community transformations. Though our mission is targeted and prioritizes low-income and POC neighbors, the reality is that urban agriculture disproportionately draws white, often middle class people with good intentions.  This provides a rich opportunity to do anti-racist work.  We are working to educate this community as to their positionality as white people in order to build strong allies in our organization.  \r\n\r\nSo what does this all look like in the day to day?\r\n1.\tHUG creates a space for the conversation.  At every public event we have ever spoke at (really, every event) at least one person thanks us for bringing issues of oppression into the conversation.  During our Community Work Hours we have had conversations with neighbors about HUG's philosophy and vision.  We here and see that there are folks in the community hungry for a positive space to have these conversations.\r\n2.\tThe white-identified members of the leadership team all work towards self education outside of their HUG leadership and advocacy in their social and work networks.\r\n3.\tWith each event and conversation we are building our capacity to organize around these issues in Tacoma. It\u2019s a town that has fierce pride and a strongly military and organized religion influence.  We cannot stress enough the conservative nature of the community. \r\n",

We\u2019re an interesting mix of long-term residents who have seen (and worked for) the big changes in the neighborhood and newer young families and individuals.  The neighborhood is gentrifying.  With the very different perceptions and experiences on the Hilltop, HUG seeks advice, guidance and approval from community elders and residents who are most negatively impacted by gentrification.  These neighborhood advisors are currently informal relationships that are being built through \"porch conversations\".

    "narrative1": "The Northwest Down Syndrome Parent Support Group was founded in 1997. Parents of children with DS came together to support and empower new families, creating a New Parent Guide, providing current, strength-based information to new parents. In 2003, we became the Northwest Down Syndrome Association (NWDSA), launching the Reciprocal Learning Community to educate and empower families and professionals. Parents are the experts on their children, and should remain in the driver\u2019s seat in the delivery of a child\u2019s services. Service levels fluctuate, and collaborating to build family and community capacity is key to the success of our families. Working in a framework of civil and human rights, we strive to instill the power of self-determination, to enable children with disabilities to grow into self-directed, contributing adults. \r\n\r\nToday, NWDSA\u2019s scope includes the All Born \u201cIn\u201d Movement, which encompasses visual resources, legislative and community advocacy around disability rights, awareness work, IEP workshops, and the All Born \u201cIn\u201d inclusive education conference. Our consciousness-raising work reflects best practices \u2013 and has been instrumental in creating strength-based practices through our partnerships and continued dialogue with parents, professionals and community leaders. We are a grass-roots group, relying on the contributions of our local communities to sustain us. We strive to make our events and workshops accessible to all families, regardless of financial need. We communicate regularly with 1400 families and professionals, from all socio-economic, racial and ethnic groups. We strive to be creators, not consumers of services, and to replace isolation and fear with knowledge, community and empowerment. We are on the pointy edge of change, and we consistently challenge policies and procedures that are not forward thinking. We are well regarded by an array of local, state and national organizations for our integrity and uncompromising stance on promoting the dignity and worth of all people.\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The disability community experiences high rates of discrimination, social injustice and disenfranchisement. School children are marginalized, segregated from their peers, and taught with low expectations. In Oregon, most kindergartners with significant developmental disabilities begin school in self-contained settings, directly opposite to best practices around inclusion in general education classrooms. Young adults face bleak options: 80% unemployment, chronic under-employment, group respite \u201cdaycare\u201d, or subminimum wage employment. State data for Oregon and Washington show less than 1% integrated employment (www.statedata.info) across all disabilities, with about 40% of adults living below the poverty line. Federal and state social service regulations often prevent adults with disabilities from obtaining gainful employment and living independently. Social isolation and healthcare inequities are a distressing reality for many individuals with disabilities. \r\n\r\nNWDSA empowers families to lead lives of independence, community involvement, and citizenship. We build a culture of acceptance and sense of community for young families, introduce them to school inclusion best practices, and continue to support them intensively through the Reciprocal Learning Community (birth-5), Kindergarten Inclusion Cohort (late preschool),and  the All Born In Conference (all ages). We support a community of advocates to build awareness, challenge social inequities, and achieve positive change in the wider society.\r\n\r\nNWDSA builds collective power in several ways.  We bring families together to learn in community. We build a network of advocates sharing best practices around inclusion, education and healthcare. We host advocacy days for families to share concerns with our legislators. Programming is parent-driven, which means that we address needs as families experience them. Parents are encouraged to hold onto their dreams for their children, and to encourage their children on a path of self-determination as they enter adulthood. \r\n\r\nBy empowering families to begin to challenge oppression from their children\u2019s earliest days, we are combating the isolation and disenfranchisement that have become status quo for individuals living with disabilities in this country. It is our hope that by participating in programs such as the Kindergarten Inclusion Cohort, and participating in presentations and advocacy days, families in our community will be strong advocates in the disability rights movement, helping to challenge the perception that individuals and families who experience disability are dependent victims. We have a proven track record for developing responsive, effective and innovative programming and partnerships that shift this perception within families and communities. \r\n\r\nTo broaden our reach and inform our work, NWDSA strategically reaches out to community partners whose work aligns with our organization\u2019s empowering values. Partners include Portland Parents Union, OrFirst, Padres en Accion, Portland State University, Concordia University, Disability Rights Oregon, Oregon Technology Access Program, OHSU, Albina Head Start, Oregon Division for Early Childhood, Clark County Parent Coalition, area Education Service Districts, and many area school districts. \r\n",

As we plan for the coming year we consider: the major civil rights issues impacting our communities; family-driven data collected at the Resourcefulness Center (through requests and queries made by phone, email, conversation, etc); our staffing and volunteer/community assets; other groups in the area who may be working to address the same needs. We implement the SWOT process each year, examining our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats as a board and staff. We strive to create responsive, sustainable programming that meets the needs of our community, inspires joy and disability pride, and promotes social change.\r\n\r\nWe collect evaluations before and after every major program (and provide incentives for people to submit them so we get a good response rate), hold postmortem meetings to examine the programs from a staff perspective and a consumer perspective (through evaluations) to inform our programming for the future, and we discuss all major programming with our Board of Directors throughout the year to make sure it is in line with our mission and values, as well as the strategic plan built at the annual Board Retreat. \r\n\r\nOur seven areas of emphasis are listed below, and are a key to the goals/objectives listed below.. \r\n\r\n1.\tProduce a proactive and durable body of work to support our programming around building inclusive communities\r\n2.\tEngage in political and social action to combat oppression\r\n3.\tCommunity building and celebrations\r\n4.\tLeadership development\r\n5.\tAwareness work (photo project and video work)\r\n6.\tSustainability\r\n7.\tGrow partnerships and collaborations\r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "NWDSA has been instrumental in the formation of two local coalitions, the All Born \u201cIn\u201d movement, and the Coalition for Universal Design for Living and Learning. The All Born \u201cIn\u201d (ABI) movement is a group of parents, professionals and organizations working together to promote community and school inclusion. Members of ABI work together build awareness and challenge the culture of oppression of individuals with disabilities in our society, from early childhood inclusion programs to support for inclusive classrooms and conversations around supported employment and independent living. Together we create proactive resources such as a photo banner display and We All Belong, a short documentary about inclusion as a civil rights issue. By creating a coalition of parents, professionals and policy makers to collaborate on these issues, we ensure that our work is responsive to all members of the community. The annual All Born \u201cIn\u201d conference and the All Born \u201cIn\u201d website highlight this movement and bring it to a larger audience. \r\n\r\nThe Coalition for Universal Design for Living and Learning grew out of the work of the All Born \u201cIn\u201d movement. The focus of this group is to bring best practices around educational and facilities equity and access to the forefront of conversations around policy decisions. This grassroots movement grows from and links with advocacy around Universal Design for Learning at the federal, state and local level. The Coalition has presented locally at a meeting of the Portland Public Schools Long Range Facilities Planning group.\r\n\r\nWe have participated in other coalitions over the past 10 years, including Equity in Education for All, a coalition led by parents and supported by local organizations addressing inequities, discrimination and segregation of students with disabilities in Portland Public Schools. NWDSA board and staff members were involved in compiling resources and presenting information at events. ", 
    "narrative6": "With an estimated 1 in 5 Americans living with a disability, individuals with disabilities make up the largest minority group in this country, and one of the most invisible. Individuals with disabilities often live in segregation, barred access from the opportunity to earn a living wage and obtain affordable housing. Disabilities occur in families from across the socioeconomic and racial spectrum, and individuals with disabilities experience high rates of poverty, unemployment and discrimination in schools, the workplace and the community. Disability is frequently not a part of the narrative about diversity in this country, yet the oppression experienced by this community has many parallels with racism, economic injustice, homophobia and other forms of oppression. NWDSA aligns closely with the national disability rights movement (National Disability Rights Network Chair Michael Bailey is a key adviser to the NWDSA, and the first parent to lead this vital legal protection and advocacy organization), and our parent-led work is complementary to incredible social justice work being done by self-advocate led groups such as ADAPT and the Autism Self Advocacy Network. \r\n\r\nOur leadership is made up of parents who experience oppression as they advocate for their children to be included in schools and communities. Parents of children with cognitive disabilities experience prejudice and stigma in parenting their children. A generation ago children with disabilities were routinely signed into institutions and endured forced sterilizations. They were called uneducable as recently as the 1970\u2019s and it was parents that led the fight to educate our children, and parents continue to push for the necessary changes in policy and enforcement. \r\n\r\nAs our leadership is primarily white, we are strategic in reaching out to make alliances with groups who work with families of color, including the Portland Parents\u2019 Union, OrFirst and Padres en Accion. From our earliest days we have had high levels of participation from the Hispanic community, with outreach volunteers translating materials and providing welcome at events. We have a strong group of Spanish-speaking parents taking the lead in this work. We are building cultural bridges to the local black community through our work with the Portland Parents Union. Children with cognitive disabilities and children of color both experience high rates of push-out and school exclusion, which provides a strong foundation for collaboration. Additionally, many of the things that families contact us about \u2013 heart surgery and other medical concerns, accessing services and entitlements, IEP support \u2013 cut across all racial boundaries.

    "narrative1": "The United States (US) has the highest documented incarceration rate in the world.  Today, the US represents 5% of the world population and has 25% of world prisoners.  Combining the number of people in prison and jail with those under parole or probation supervision, approximately 1 in every 31 adults, or 3.2 percent of the population is under some form of correctional control.  Incarceration has increasingly become an inefficient panacea for many other social issues such as mental illness, racism, poverty, homelessness, and drug addiction. \r\n\r\nYoga Behind Bars (YBB) is Washington State\u2019s only nonprofit organization offering yoga and meditation classes in prisons, jails and detention centers. Starting with one yoga teacher in one facility in 2008, today a team of 40 yoga instructors teach 18 classes a week in seven correctional facilities in the greater Puget Sound region, sharing accessible and effective mind-body health interventions and tools with thousands of youth and adults. Every day an average of 30 incarcerated students practice yoga and meditation. This fall we will expand our reach to include Denney Juvenile Justice Center and add a meditation program for men in solitary confinement at the Intensive Management Unit at Monroe Correctional Complex.\r\n\r\nYoga Behind Bars envisions a society where all people are safe, healthy and free. We are committed to a just and empowering criminal justice system, where prisoners are given the opportunity to heal and prepare for their release. With the number of programs in prisons focused on recovery, rehabilitation and health declining drastically, Yoga Behind Bars seeks to address the immediate physical, psychological and spiritual needs of imprisoned youth, men, and women, while also working towards large systemic change.\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Our criminal justice system is failing us. It is not making people safer, it is unjust, it is ineffective and expensive; and it hurts marginalized communities the most. Since 1970 our prison population has grown 700%, and the effects of this surge have been concentrated among the poor, immigrants, and people of color. Researchers argue that the negative effect on children of incarcerated parents is so great that mass imprisonment increases future racial and class inequality.   \r\n\r\nYoga Behind Bars advocates for prisons and jails to be places of effective, deep healing, and for alternatives to punishment and imprisonment. Ultimately, we need to build communities, not prisons. \r\n\r\nEven though the numbers are outrageous and the effects devastating, mass incarceration is largely overlooked and social justice work in this area is underfunded. Yoga Behind Bars is dedicated to solving this crisis by 1) offering proven modalities to increase the health and well-being of prisoners, facilitating change from within; 2) building awareness about the US criminal justice system, particularly among privileged whites; 3) sharing tools to challenge racism and privilege with yoga teachers; 4) partnering with other groups who are building a grassroots movement to end mass incarceration. \r\n\r\nWe believe in the innate value of every being and respect their wisdom and freedom of choice. Each of us has the intrinsic capacity for wholeness, growth and positive transformation. We receive letters from all over the state, country and even the world from incarcerated people asking for a yoga program at their facility. It is critical that yoga and its beneficial effects on physical and emotional well-being are made available to everyone, not just to those who can afford to pay for classes. Most prisoners suffer from chronic trauma such as abandonment, sexual abuse, discrimination, drug abuse, and witnessing crime. Yoga has been found to be an effective tool in helping release this unresolved trauma, and has been proven to be a powerful tool for restoring the connection between mind, heart and body. \r\n",

In order to support the expansion of the number of classes, workshops, and number of correctional facilities served, we would like to add a part-time Programs Manager position. We are also in the process of starting a Programs Committee. \r\n\r\nAdvocacy: Develop and implement a plan for increased advocacy efforts on the local and state government levels. \r\n\r\nSocial Justice: Further develop the social justice component of our teacher training and attract teachers who reflect the diversity of our students. Staff and board are attending trainings on undoing institutionalized racism, and we are soliciting advice from leaders in the field to help us improve our work in this area. This is new territory for Yoga Behind Bars and we are extremely committed to stepping up our efforts.\r\n\r\nCapacity: Build a sustainable infrastructure for the organization to continue to meet the growing need for programs. Yoga Behind Bars is growing its Board of Directors and has hired a new Development Director. We are building relationships with institutional funders, but are mostly focusing on individual donors. \r\n\r\nPartnerships: Expand our network of nonprofit partnerships to advance the movement to end mass incarceration. As a grassroots nonprofit, sharing resources is essential. We continue to reach out to other organizations committed to social justice and healthy communities.\r\n\r\nWe will measure our success by looking at: 1) How many students we have served at how many facilities; 2) The number of meetings with legislators and government officials; 3) The diversity of our teachers and board of directors; 4) The number of individual and institutional supporters of our work; 5) The depth and number of partnerships with other organizations.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Yoga Behind Bars has ongoing partnerships with Street Yoga Seattle, University Beyond Bars, and many yoga studios around the Puget Sound. In order to build a strong grassroots movement for social justice and to have greater impact, these alliances and collaborations are critical. Yoga Behind Bars is a leader in the yoga service field, but our desired range of influence is far greater than that. We know that to truly raise public awareness, change public behavior, access certain resources, or influence policy decisions, we need to work together. In short, collectively we can meet the challenges of inequality and injustice more effectively and more quickly.\r\n\r\nThrough our partnership with University Beyond Bars we have been able to run a yoga program at Monroe Correctional Center\u2019s Washington State Reformatory Unit for the past 2 years. With Street Yoga Seattle we are mobilizing the Seattle yoga community to raise funds for our work with marginalized youth and incarcerated people. Since we are a larger organization, we are sharing our network, as well as our expertise in event planning and community outreach, with Street Yoga. Our ongoing partnerships with yoga studios help us reach thousands of yoga practitioners; raising awareness about our work and the mass incarceration crisis. Many yoga studios in the Puget Sound region are ambassadors for our work, bringing many new people to join Yoga Behind Bars as volunteers and supporters.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "At this time Yoga Behind Bars is primarily a white-led organization, and we are working hard to change this. Most yoga teachers are white women, and this is also true for Yoga Behind Bars' teachers and leadership. Funding from the Social Justice Fund would support our efforts to partner with other social justice organizations, and help us work towards one of our long-term goals: to increase the diversity of yoga practitioners and teachers in Washington State and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe potential for social change is huge. Over the years, we have seen how our volunteers are connected, inspired, and transformed in the process of working for Yoga Behind Bars. They become active advocates for social justice and in the process affect their families and communities\u2014creating a ripple of change. In the US more than 15 million people practice yoga, if we are able to reach even a fraction of these people, this can be a very powerful lever for greater social impact. By building a bridge between yoga studios and prisons, and seeking common ground based on progressive solutions, true social change is possible. We are excited to continue to work towards a world where all people are safe, healthy and free.\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative1": "   University Beyond Bars (UBB) provides post-secondary education to men and women in Washington state prisons, particularly people of color, and raises public awareness of prison issues.\r\n    UBB was founded in 2005 by Carol Estes and Gary Idleburg, both volunteers for the Black Prisoners Caucus at Washington State Reformatory (WSR) from 2001 and 2005. For five years, Idleburg and Estes taught classes in business, creative writing, and African American history. Finding that their classes were filled with intelligent, capable men who would face a daunting maze of legal, social, and financial hurdles upon release, they decided to stack the deck in the men\u2019s favor by finding a way for them to get credit for their work. \r\n   They founded UBB with two primary goals:  1) to provide an opportunity for people in prison, particularly people of color, to earn college credit and college degrees, and 2) to educate the public about criminal justice issues.  \r\n    In the U.S., education has historically been the path out of poverty, and we intended to open the gate for those whom our legal system and our society has denied access.  But it would not be easy, since our state legislature prohibited public funding for prison college programs and Congress had outlawed the use of Pell Grants and federal student loans by prisoners in 1994. \r\nNevertheless, from our first business class in 2005, completed by just four students, UBB at WSR has grown to serve about 130 students, or about 1 out of 7 inmates there. We offer about 18 classes each semester, about half for college credit, taught by volunteer faculty from area college and universities. Our students have earned over 2,000 hours of college credit and seven associate\u2019s degrees, despite our state\u2019s prohibition on funding for college classes in prison.\t\r\n",

    "narrative3": "    We use higher education to break down long-standing barriers to upward mobility\u2014class, poverty, and race\u2014for those with the least access to it: prisoners. We hope, by our example and our advocacy, to push our state into acknowledging the failures of our criminal justice system and addressing them.   \r\n    The most important ancestor of the U.S. prison system is the system of slavery and indentured servitude upon which our country was built. Because the Founding Fathers feared true democracy and equitable distribution of wealth, they worked to protect the interests of propertied classes against the poor, non-white, and women. Even when slavery was finally abolished by the 13th Amendment, prisons were not included; to this day, slavery and involuntary servitude are permitted in prisons by the Constitution. \r\n    Today, men and women in prison are effectively branded for life by a prison sentence. In prison, the highest education level they can achieve outside UBB is a GED, which will relegate them and their families to poverty. When they leave prison, they face a maze of laws and rules that can quickly send them back to prison for a minor misstep. And they leave with only $40, a felony record, and a heavy debt burden\u2014court fees, fines, and cost of incarceration the state has levied against them. They have no IDs, no transportation, no money, and often nowhere to turn. Few apartments will accept them, and 80% will be unemployed at some point during the first year.\r\n    At UBB, we offer more than college classes: we confront public stereotypes, ignorance, and fear through our appearances at frequent speaking engagements and legislative hearings, and through our radio show, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Disappeared.\u201d Inside the prison, we create an alternative, education-based culture and train social change leaders. Our sociology classes, for example, teach men to question the philosophy of individual responsibility that they are force-fed\u2014the idea that you and you alone are responsible for your crime. Sociologists tell us that many factors determine whether an individual ends up in prison, including the decision he made to commit the crime\u2014such as factors as poverty, racism, failing foster care, the school-to-prison pipeline, drug addiction, and irrational public fear. We often bring legislators and prosecutors into the prison to give them an accurate, unhysterical, human perspective on prisons. \r\n    We expect the men who leave our program to go public about the prison experience in writing and speaking at legislative hearings, churches, and other locations, and to work to address the fear that underlies injustice by their personal example. We do the same ourselves.\r\n",

Because a key element of UBB is the involvement of prisoners themselves, our first step will be identifying, recruiting, and bringing together Prisoner Advisory Committees in each new institution. They must represent the spectrum of races and prison groups at the institution. That involves persuading men to set aside gang- and other prison affiliations in favor of a culture of mutual respect and common purpose.\r\n    To pass parole legislation. Rep. Mary Helen Roberts, vice-chair of the House Public Safety Committee, has agreed to introduce parole legislation in January, which we will write with the prisoners. Parole is an essential part of education, because it incentivizes the difficult discipline of working toward personal change. \r\n    To pass legislation permitting public funding of prison college programs. We will continue to work with Rep. Seaquist to open the door for at least minimal public money for prison college programs through meetings with legislators and coalition building.\r\nWe will have met our expansion objectives when 1) we have promoted, recruited and established PAC\u2019s operating at both institutions and are running 1-2 classes at both institutions. We will have achieved our financial goals when a quarter to a half of our staff salary is guaranteed through monthly membership donations. We will have achieved our political goals when acceptable legislation passes. That could take several years, but in the meantime, we can measure interim steps: achieving hearings in the House and Senate, a floor vote, etc. \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "     A small, independent nonprofit like UBB is surprisingly well-positioned to influence change. But as a David among the Goliaths, we must address the power differential by building correctional, educational, and political alliances. \r\nWe work with the DOC at all levels and mentor the Freedom Education Project (a program at the women\u2019s prison modeled after ours).\t\r\n     We collaborate with Edmonds Community College and Ohio University to provide college credit for our students, and we assist Transitional Education Behind Bars (TEBB) at UW bring college classes into the prisons. \r\n     We work with political advocacy organizations such as the Friends Committee on Washington Public Policy and the Faith Action Network toward our political goals of 1) removing the state\u2019s prohibition against funding higher education for prisoners and 2) returning parole to our state. UBB has been an invited presenter at two legislative work sessions on prison education and testified at several hearings. We helped write, with the prisoners, two parole bills and a prison education bill. We also arranged an influential joint work session at WSR of two legislative committees, where prisoners presented papers to legislators. Currently, we are partnering with the Concerned Lifers Organization at WSR to create a September summit on parole at the prison, involving legislators, prosecutors, academic experts, and prisoners.  \r\n     Our goal is to make Washington a national leader in progressive prison reform. To accomplish this, our director is working with People4Parole, an organization of prisoners\u2019 families she founded, and organizing a coalition of organizations to support a bill that will be introduced in January 2014. Over the long term, UBB will work with legislators to turn this coalition into a strong advocacy organization for progressive criminal justice reform similar to Oregon\u2019s Safety and Justice Coalition.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "     Because UBB was born out of the Black Prisoners Caucus, it is rooted in an acute awareness of the disproportionate jailing of people of color and the grim results of poverty and the school-to-prison pipeline. So from the first, and because cofounder Gary Idleburg himself is African American, we have prioritized people of color. We have also seen from the beginning the tragic squandering of intelligence and human potential that racist justice policy represents.\r\n     Nationally, black men are, imprisoned at 6-8 times the rate of whites\u2014in our state, at 7 times the rate of whites. Yet between 1980 and 2000, racial disparity did not increase, criminologist Bruce Western notes in Punishment and Inequality in America. Instead, class inequality did.  \u201cA large gap in the prevalence of imprisonment opened between college-educated and noncollege men,\u201d he writes. The lifetime risk of going to prison doubled, but nearly all of the increase was experienced by those with just a high school education. Of young black men who never finished high school, 34% found themselves in prison, as opposed to 6.7% of white male high school dropouts. But regardless of race, a high school dropout is five times more likely to go to prison than a high school graduate, Western writes. On the other hand,\u201cthe protective effects of a college education are clear,\u201d he says. \u201cFewer than 1 percent of college-educated black men were admitted to prison in the late 1990s.\u201d (Statistics from Western)\r\n     This is why our work in addressing injustice, racism, and oppression has focused on higher education. It is the single most promising means of interrupting the cycle of poverty and prison. And according to the Bureau of Justice, it is also the single most effective means of reducing recidivism. \r\n     Yet a solid education is one element often missing from the lives of most people who end up in prison, both black and white. Becoming a college graduate opens up career possibilities many men never imagined. \u201cYour class was the first time ever thought I could be anything besides a drug dealer,\u201d one young black student commented. This is what we hope to awaken: the knowledge that the barricades that keep poor people and people of color narrowly confined can be breached through education.\r\n",

Working with prisoners day in and day out, without Department of Corrections representatives present, UBB teachers and volunteers gain an understanding of the system that those making the laws in Olympia, or those writing the policies in Tumwater, simply don\u2019t have. We work with the men to communicate those insights to the legislature and to the DOC. We also play a unique role as go-betweens, explaining to legislators why the policy that sounded like a good idea is horrible in its execution, explaining to the public that the people in prison are not monsters but regular folks\u2014the people down the street or the people they went to high school with, and explaining to prisoners why legislators insist that they have to make changes slowly, bit by bit. Most of all, we try to counteract the negative forces of racism, poverty, and oppression by offering those who are most impacted by them a ticket into the middle class. Sometimes a college education won\u2019t change anything, but often it does, and given that we are one small, underfunded nonprofit, it\u2019s surprising how often what we say, and what the prisoners say, now matters in Olympia.

    "narrative3": "API in Oregon are under-represented in civic engagement, policy advocacy, and leadership development.  While Asians and Pacific Islanders are the 2nd largest and 2nd fastest growing populations in our state, our community faces barriers across diverse languages, cultures and immigration experiences.  Of the new arrival Oregonians, Asians comprise the vast majority through refugee resettlement from Burma, Bhutan and Iraq.  Theories such as the model minority stereotype promotes the notion that we are all experience prosperity when the facts demonstrate persistent disparities.  Disaggregated data shows deep disparities within API communities in areas of health, education, jobs and more.  Anti-immigrant racism and barriers to public institutions and benefits have a significant impact particularly on newcomer immigrants and refugees who experience higher rates of poverty and lack of education.\r\n\r\nOne community we seek to empower are residents from the Compact of Free Association States (COFA) which include the states of Palau, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. COFA citizens have freedom to work and travel in the United States in exchange for US military interests in those nations. The US has assumed the obligation to ensure the health, housing, and security of COFA residents, but has fell short. In Oregon, there are over 4,000 COFA residents, a population that has grown 68% from 2000 to 2010. While data is incomplete, Pacific Islanders face the highest rates of poverty in Oregon at 45% in 2010. This is because COFA residents face barriers and lack of eligibility to many public services due to their non-citizen legal resident status. They have less access to health care, education, and other social services. Additionally, the COFA Impact Fund established by the US in return for military interests is not meeting the needs of COFA residents in the US. \r\n\r\nAPANO works to identify and address the disparities that impact our communities through community organizing, leadership development and grassroots advocacy.  We believe that by building a strong coalition of our API communities, we will be able to address the inequities we face. With regard to COPA residents, we have worked with our COFA partner organizations to ensure they do not slip through bureaucratic cracks and to empower such communities to advocate for social equality. For example, our coalition won the passing of Oregon HB 2517 to restore drivers license access to COFA residents through a series of leadership trainings, legislative days, and other forms of lobbying. We will also continue to work for the full restoration of Medicaid for COFA residents. One of the primary root causes of such disparities is that COFA residents come to the US without the resources or knowledge and experience to stand up and advocate for their own rights. \r\n\r\n",

    "narrative4": "This project addresses the root causes of disparities in access to social services by COFA residents by empowering these communities to work together to increase civic engagement, base building, political advocacy and leadership development within their communities. APANO's strategy is to develop a closer relationship with the Micronesian Islander Community of Oregon (MIC) and other growing Pacific Islander community groups and provide additional support to hold COFA issue centered legislative days, leadership trainings, and work to integrate MIC with other Pacific Islanders communities nationwide to  promote the exchange of information an ideas to work on issues at a federal level. The grant will support a series of ongoing leadership trainings for an emerging COFA resident leadership, work to integrate the leadership into a broader API political context, and hold a number of events to raise the profile of COFA communities within mainstream culture and politics. COFA residents have felt the need to gain access to broader support and resources and have reached out to APANO to collaborate on projects and attend leadership seminars. This grant would provide broader support to strengthen these relationships and expand the capacity of APANO to provide greater leadership support.\r\n\r\nOur goals will be met when we have recruited and trained 10 new COFA leaders among the various communities, jointly have held 2-4 events within these communities highlighting Pacific Islander culture and civic engagement, and have developed a lasting politicized and self sufficient community that can effectively advocate for systematic change. Due to a lack of mainstream funding for the Pacific Islander community, this grant is greatly needed to develop and expand the capacity of COFA community organizations.", 
    "narrative5": "Strong relationships are the foundation for meaningful change. Our experiences as Asians and Pacific Islanders inspire our partnerships with each other and promote our coalition building in order to find solutions to shared concerns. APANO values partnership and is an active partner and regular thought leader with the Micronesian Islander Community of Oregon (MIC) and the Oregon Health Equity Alliance (OHEA) among a larger base of organizations.\r\n\r\nMIC is organized exclusively for charitable, educational purpose and to promote cultural awareness programs and events that provide social needs, economic growth and justice to Micronesian communities among Oregon. APANO has been a supporter to MIC since its inception and has been involved with collaborating on legislative days and provided leadership training to MIC members. We seek to continue to assist MIC and other Pacific Islander community organizations build their capacity for social change work.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon Health Equity Alliance formalizes cross-sector partnerships to provide statewide leadership for policy change that improves the health outcomes.  OHEA utilizes a social determinants of health framework, and primarily works on issues with statewide impact.  In the 2013 session, OHEA has prioritized and led efforts for upstream health issues including restoration of driver license for undocumented immigrants, tuition equity, and direct health policy issues of cultural competency for licensed health professionals, uniform data collection of race, ethnicity and language, and full prenatal care for undocumented women. This partnership supports our mission to improve health outcomes for the API community.\r\n\r\nIn these collaborations, we provide a strong leadership presence as well as some financial and training support. These collaborations strengthen our collective voice and while coalition partners may be identity based versus issue based, they build a broader and more unified progressive moment by taking advantage of synergies in advocating for policy change and magnifying each organizations' reach.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "We envision a just and equitable world where Asians and Pacific Islanders are fully engaged in the social, economic and political issues that affect us. The root causes of inequities are connected and shape our social justice and human rights work. We stand in solidarity with other communities who experience oppression.\r\n\r\nAPANO's Board adopted a new strategic plan in late 2012 that centers our strategic focus on increasing racial equity particularly in health and education systems, and further defined our analysis and framework of racial justice and community organizing.  In 2013, we have worked successfully to pass Oregon's first cultural competency for health care professionals bill and a legislation establishing uniform data collection of race, ethnicity, language and disability for health and human services.  Both of these issues have been prioritized through APANO's community driven strategic planning process that engaged over 200 members.  These bills improve accessibility and better statistical information to address the needs of our diverse communities. \r\n\r\nA concrete example of our ongoing connecting between different forms of oppression is our leadership in the Racial Equity Report Card (RERC). The RERC is a 2 year old collaboration of leading social and racial justice organizations that issues a legislative report card, a multi-issue and multiracial assessment of the legislative session, evaluating lawmakers commitment to advancing opportunity and closing disparities affecting Oregonians, particularly Oregonians of Color.  2011 was the first year of the project, and the report card achieved high visibility with over a dozen media hits, led to foundational analysis of racial equity in public policy for lawmakers and their staff, and has sustained dialogue with electeds and leadership led by communities of color, immigrants and refugees. APANO serves on the leadership working group alongside Basic Rights Education Fund, Causa Oregon, Center for Intercultural Organizing, Partnership for Safety and Justice, Urban League of Portland, and Western States Center, and co-convene an advisory group of over 25 labor, faith and community organizations. APANO has led fundraising efforts to build the capacity of working group members to deepen their engagement in the project, and has benefited from ongoing working relationships with BRO\u2019s Racial Justice Alliance Building Project and PSJ\u2019s Criminal Justice Reform efforts.",

    "narrative3": "Problems: Multicultural families with special needs are often unaware of school and/or government programs serving disabilities, remaining isolated and without access. Many come from cultures that do not recognize or serve disability needs and lack awareness of services offered through local and Federal agencies in the United States.  Mainstream services are neither culturally nor linguistically appropriate.  \r\nRoot causes include: language and cultural barriers, lack of understanding or ability to self-advocate. Many families are isolated from their subcultures due to social stigma and lack of understanding or acceptance of disability issues and struggling to cope with special needs children without support.  Social inequity and injustice service systems and lack of culturally and linguistically competent policy.\r\nCollective power: We collaborated with 21 community service organizations in the first phase of our Multicultural Disabilities Network which we continue to build, partnered with Highline, Kent and Federal Way Schools to reach and serve limited English proficiency families. We bring families together through focus groups and parent helps parent activities so that they become politicized and vocal. This strengthens bonds within families, communities and bridges cultural differences. We provide parent leadership training to help them address major discrimination against disabilities and increase their advocacy skills.  And through our Community Parent Resource Center Grant (funded by OSEP) we work hard to break institutional racism in the education system. Community involvement is how we work for system change to improve service for the most vulnerable population.  The Executive Director is an passionate and strong advocate who serve as an Advisory Committee member for WA State Title XIX Medicare and Medicaid program, King County Mobility for Low Income Fare Ad Hoc Committee, Kent City Diversity Initiative Group, and King County Parent Coalition (parent advocacy group for people with disabilities).  \r\nChanging root causes: Open Doors is driven by the needs of families we serve by working within their community in their own languages to link to services for their children and through leadership training, empower parents to advocate for their children's educational outcomes.  We are changing root causes through parent focus groups that provide feedback to government programs for system changes. For example, by providing language support, families provided feedback to King County Developmental Disability Division to improve services for disability clients. By focusing on community organization, social justice causes for the most under served. By providing language and cultural support families can advocate for their children.  Our new Multicultural Youth Leadership Program led by youth with disabilities and their peers will address issues and challenges such as bullying and discrimination. We conduct cultural competence training to educators and administrators and provide technical support to development disabilities division for their strategic planning.\r\n",

We will complete the two projects, so volunteer handbooks, job descriptions, training and orientation process and a list of past volunteers and strategies to recruit potential volunteers will be developed.  Then we will institute the volunteer program with fund allocation for a volunteer manager position. The program will also bring the disability awareness and positive images of people with disabilities to our communities. \r\nAssess the success:  From the volunteer data base and activity logs, we will know how many skilled volunteers work for us in what capacity for how many hours in 2014.\r\nb)    By Aug 2014, a fund development and marketing plan for sustaining organizational infrastructures and financial stability is developed and ready for implementation.\r\nStrategies: The Board has formed fundraising and marketing committees to address our financial needs and wellbeing.  To meet our rapid growth needs, we have applied the Catalyst grant to request consultant services on sustainable fund development plan.  The Executive Director and two representatives from the Board will work closely with 501 Commons, a nonprofit assistant agency, to develop an action plan for sustaining our programs, services and future expansion. \r\nAssess the success:  When the fund development plan is approved by the Board by 2014 and ready for implementation, we know that we have accomplished this goal.\r\n",

For FWPS, decisions are made collaboratively based on suggestions and recommendations by both parties. We have shared vision that students and families are the center of services.

These groups are also most often the economically deprived. Our mission is to reach isolated families left behind to assist them with parent education, training, and leadership and advocacy skills that will enable them to speak for themselves. Due to the backgrounds of many families, this work requires much training and follow-up support by our multicultural staff who speak their languages and understand cultural barriers and taboos.\r\nFamilies of color with limited economic resources, struggling with cultural and language barriers, endure multiple levels of injustice and discrimination. Add to that a child with a disability with all the associated social discrimination often makes them outcasts both in larger society as well as their smaller cultural groups. These families are isolated from mainstream opportunities by language barriers, cultural isolation, and often suffer discrimination because disabilities not only in their local communities but also in the educational system. We advocate for equal access working closely with Federal Way, Highline and Kent Public Schools/Special Ed department to make sure special students' needs are appropriately addressed.  Statistics identified that minority youth, particular African American and Latino male students are over identified in the Special Education Programs.  By working closely with public schools, Open Doors is addressing this racial disparity issue due to institutional racism at presentations and workshops at schools and communities.  In addition, our cultural competence training with strong focus on culture and disabilities provides tools, tips, and resources to increase community service providers\u2019 knowledge to include this vulnerable population in their programs and services.   \r\nWe are closely linked with various ethnic and culturally diverse organizations.

Riverkeeper was formed in 2000 through the merger of two separate groups working on Columbia River issues in order to create a single group dedicated to protecting the entire U.S. portion of the Columbia.  We pride ourselves on being a grassroots activist group that strategically integrates community-based organizing with legal enforcement of key environmental laws, public education, and hands-on citizen involvement in river protection projects.  \r\n\r\nWe work closely with communities directly impacted by toxic pollution.  Unfortunately, the areas suffering from the worst water quality are typically low income or minority populations.  Our strategy to address these environmental justice issues ranges from working with Umatilla Indian Reservation to reduce toxics in salmon to residents of the urban Rosemere Neighborhood Association in Vancouver, WA, where we forced the cleanup of toxic waste that had been leaching PCBs into the river for 20 years.\r\n\r\nRiverkeeper is recognized today as the leading environmental organization working to protect the Columbia.  Our strength lies in working with volunteers, Tribes, small organizations and river communities, and our strong relationships with volunteers and allies throughout the river basin allow us to achieve real results, often against powerful opposition.  In 2011, we helped convince the State of Oregon to enact the most protective toxic pollution limits in America. This will lead to significant reductions in the toxic pollution released into the Columbia and better health outcomes.  We celebrated a major success when we stopped Oregon Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from building dirty and dangerous export terminals to ship LNG overseas, which would have destroyed acres of family farms, forests, and key salmon habitat.

    "narrative3": "Washington\u2019s unrealistically low fish consumption rate puts Tribal members, low income subsistence fishers, and immigrant populations at greater risk of cancer and other serious health problems.  A 2002 study by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that members of the four Columbia River treaty tribes who regularly consume fish may have cancer risks that are up to 50 times higher than the general public who consume fish about once per month.  Many immigrant fishers likely fare far worse, but are not studied or tested.  Riverkeeper recently visited popular fishing locations on the mid and lower Columbia and asked fishermen if we could sample the fish they were taking home to feed their families.  A sucker from the Columbia Slough caught by Romanian immigrant Daniel Pop contained cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 27,000% above the safe level for human consumption established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as unsafe levels of mercury, arsenic and flame retardants.  Because Washington\u2019s pollution limits are designed to protect a person who only eats fish once per month, Washington fails to protect people who regularly consume fish, particularly those who eat fish daily.  We have a chance to correct this injustice, but powerful industries in Puget Sound are lining up and saying that people should eat less fish.\r\n\r\nWashington agencies are not successful at cracking down on pollution or cleaning up abandoned dumps sites.  Large industrial players heavily influence the legislatures, which repeatedly gut the agencies\u2019 budgets for toxic pollutant monitoring and enforcement of environmental laws.  To compound the problem, the populations most highly affected by high toxics concentrations in the Columbia are either Native Americans or low-income residents, whose voices are often underrepresented.  Enacting more protective toxics standards requires a combination of grassroots organizing and strong coalitions with Tribes and other affected groups combined with policy and scientific expertise.  We worked to bring substantial media attention to the high levels of toxics in fish consumed by local fishermen like Daniel Pop as a part of our public advocacy campaign, elevating the voices of citizens who are rarely heard.  Building power and organizing in effected communities and working with Tribal leaders will allow us to overcome the opposition of powerful industry polluters in the short term and will build collective power long term as well.  Riverkeeper has been particularly effective at organizing community groups that operate autonomously and continue to push for change at a local level long-term.  We can provide critical strategy, legal and scientific input that ordinary citizens might not have access to, strengthening their local organizing.\r\n",

In 2013-2014, Ecology should establish new water quality standards based, in part, on how much fish people eat.  Our strategy is multi-pronged.  We will start by building a coalition of at least ten tribes and eight key conservation and business groups who support stronger protections.  Next, we\u2019ll launch a public pressure campaign to submit at least 1,000 public comments to Ecology along with a media component generating 20 stories that highlight the often unheard voices of tribal and immigrant fishers.  We will provide rulemaking language to Ecology to draw attention to industries\u2019 attempts at loopholes as well as provide comments on draft language of fish consumption rules.  If necessary, we will further pressure Ecology by filing a challenge to the EPA, pushing them to promulgate new standards to replace Washington\u2019s failed standards.  Each of these tactics within our overall strategy includes measurable, numeric goals.  We will measure our success based upon: the speed at which Ecology completes the process (industry seeks long delay); the actual fish consumption rate (currently 6.5 grams/day, we are seeking 175 grams/day or more); the substance of the rule, which primarily means whether we successfully fend off industry loopholes; and the quantity of public participation that we organize.  Riverkeeper will conduct formal evaluations at the mid-point and end of the grant term, evaluating whether we are meeting our milestones and components of the action plan.  We will identify ways to improve the effectiveness of our campaign work, identify revised strategies, and review staff performance.  This year and 2014 provide an exciting opportunity to enact major change to Washington\u2019s water quality standards while building long term power for underrepresented groups.", 
    "narrative5": "Riverkeeper  is proud of our coalition work, which advances our work to promote environmental and social justice.  \r\n\r\nThe Toxic-free fish coalition is composed up tribal representatives from the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (represents Warm Springs, Umatilla, Yakama, and Nez Perce) and the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (represents 20 treaty tribes in western Washington), as well as conservation and environmental justice organizations.  This coalition came together to reduce toxic pollution in fish and the people that depend upon them.  Columbia Riverkeeper helped build this coalition and worked with the Indian Fisheries Commission to organize the first coalition-building meeting.  Our role is to organize grassroots communities, provide thorough and creative advocacy, and be the primary liaison between conservation groups and tribes.\r\n\r\nColumbia Riverkeeper is also a founding member of the Power Past Coal coalition, which is working to stop the shipping and exporting of coal through our communities.  The coalition includes businesses, clean energy advocates, Montana ranchers, and conservation groups concerned about the threat of dirty coal.  Riverkeeper researched and broke the story of coal export in Washington and Oregon and helped build Power Past Coal.  Our role is grassroots organizing, legal work, and helping set policy.  Power Past Coal has had great success.\r\n   \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Columbia Riverkeeper has been recognized by Tribal leaders and allies as an organization that is extremely effective at bridging the gap between environmental organizations and Tribal partners and working together to achieve racial and environmental justice for people of color.  We appreciate not only our mutual vision of resource protection that we share with tribes, but the health and well-being of the first peoples of N\u2019chi-wana (the Big River, Columbia River) and the treaty rights to hunt, fish and gather in her catchment.  We were proud to be chosen to receive a grant from the Spirit Mountain Community Fund of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde for our Common Threads project, designed to train environmental non-profits to consult and work more effectively with Tribes.  While the Pacific Northwest has seen many accomplishments due to the partnership between tribes and environmental nonprofits, we believe there is tremendous room for growth.  Through our Common Threads project we held listening sessions about best practices of consultation between tribes and non-profits, developed a model for conservation groups to consult with tribes on resource protection policies and projects in a more regular and formal manner, and obtained commitments from environmental non-profits to implement these best practices.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to our work with Tribes, Riverkeeper is also elevating the voices of immigrants by drawing media attention to their stories and the threats they face from toxic fish.  While many people in the Pacific Northwest typically eat salmon and non-resident fish that are less affected by toxic loads, immigrant fishers are often consuming the highly contaminated resident fish that are more similar to those in their native homelands, or harvesting shellfish.  Daniel Pop is a Romanian immigrant who grew up catching carp, catfish and perch and doesn't care for salmon.  \u201cThis is the fish we have in our country.  We don\u2019t have salmon,\u201d he said.  While Pop won\u2019t likely stop fishing in the Slough, he would like to see something done about the pollution. \u201cUnfortunately, the people who own the factories are not the ones down here fishing, eating the fish,\u201d he concludes.  Columbia Riverkeeper, we believe that simply telling people not to eat the fish is unacceptable, particularly since so many rely on fish for subsistence.  Instead of issuing warnings, our state needs to actually reduce the amount of toxic pollution in our rivers.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "ROP\u2019s greatest accomplishment has been building a progressive movement in rural Oregon. Our progressive movement is based on inclusion, human rights, and participatory democracy, with the human dignity group (HDG) as its basic structure.  Our success is in the development and maintenance of local pro-justice organizations that allow small town Oregonians to demand true democracy and dignity, and to challenge white supremacy, bigotry, and anti-democratic policies at every turn to transform the culture of rural Oregon in a way that ripples from the local outward to the state and federal.  \r\n\r\nAs of 2013 we work with 51 member HDGs, representing 29 of Oregon\u2019s 36 counties.  ROP, the catalyst and link between each group, fosters structural and analytical capacity to build power over the long haul.  Started by and for rural people, we drafted a mission that looked at the weapons of race, class, and gender oppression and how they were used to divide neighbors against each other.  \r\n\r\nSince 1992, ROP\u2019s mission has been \u201cto strengthen the skills, resources and vision of primary leadership in local, autonomous human dignity groups (HDGs) across the state with the goal of keeping such groups a vibrant source for a just democracy.\u201d  ROP\u2019s mission stems from our conviction that the way to shift the balance of power towards justice is through grassroots, collective, strategic action. \r\n\r\nOur overarching successes of the past 19 years include:\r\n\u2022\timpacting politics in Oregon so rural voices are at the progressive table\r\n\u2022\tcreating and sustaining a coordinated infrastructure for progressive organizing in rural Oregon that includes over 50 groups and thousands of human dignity activists\r\n\u2022\tmaintaining a broad analysis over the past decade that has expanded from our roots in the queer rights struggle to include immigrant rights, anti-war/anti-imperialism, tax fairness, funding for human needs, economic justice, choice, and environmental justice\r\n",

    "narrative3": "ROP\u2019s seeks to put rural communities at the center of the fight for economic justice with an aspirational view of the small town \u201cCommons.\u201d We use the phrase \u201cCommons\u201d to refer to public infrastructure like schools, libraries, and post offices, but also the viability of small town economies and basic community needs like social services, immigrant services, housing, and health care.\r\n\r\nROP began in the early 1990s as a \u201cFight the Right\u201d organization.  In 1992, the Right was using culture wars and wedge strategies to divide our communities and gain power. In 2013, the face of the Right in small town Oregon can be seen through Tea Party takeovers of local government, anti-immigrant rhetoric, \u201castroturf\u201d organizing to advance a neo-liberal, corporate economic agenda, and the further dismantling of public infrastructure, like the postal service and public schools.\r\n\r\nThe Citizens United ruling that corporations are people, bombardment with unlimited campaign spending in the 2012 Election, dismantling of the United States Postal Service (USPS), attempts to destabilize public unions, Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr.\u2019s statement that the Justice Department may not pursue criminal cases against big banks because it could destabilize the economy\u2026these are all symptoms of a long term agenda for corporate dominance of our politics, economy, and democracy.\r\n\r\nRural Oregon is on the front lines of the fallout and can be on the front lines of the struggle to redefine our economy.  ROP builds power by mobilizing dozens of human dignity groups and small town communities to push back with our own vision of economic justice and fairness. One example is our work with leaders in Oregon\u2019s smallest communities to defend small town Post Offices.\r\n\r\nThe Right has an anti-government, anti-worker agenda, and a multi-decade plan for eliminating our public postal service \u2013 and other public infrastructure \u2013 for privatization and corporate gain.  If successful, they would take down the 2nd largest employer in the country (after Walmart).  This is a public employer where 85% of staff have collective bargaining, 40% are women, 40% are people of color and 22% are veterans. Rural post offices are also crucial for the survival of small town communities.  \r\n\r\nROP\u2019s organizing uses rural post office organizing as a wedge against this corporate agenda from a very unanticipated constituency \u2013 the most rural towns in the state. Our small town post office work highlights the economic needs of the small communities and showcases the enormous mobilization power and impact of these same towns. In total, we reached out to 140 communities.  51 of those communities held local campaign activities \u2013 a huge and powerful base to mobilize for the next phase of ROP\u2019s small town economic justice organizing against corporate dominance.\r\n",

For example organized resistance to debt (1 in 10 mortgages have been in foreclosure at one time in some rural Oregon counties, and up to 20% of credit card debt is currently delinquent), and fighting resource extraction projects that risk environmental devastation, health impacts, and loss of identity in rural Oregon towns.\r\n\r\nROP will use three types of convenings to develop campaign plans:\r\no\tRural Caucus & Strategy Session: statewide convening of over 125 ROP/HDG leaders\r\no\tIn-community Living Room Conversations (LRCs): that deepen the connection between saving rural post offices, economic justice and Right-wing strategies to privatize our communities and defund government.  LRCs build analysis and develop local human dignity group economic justice organizing campaigns that respond to the opportunities and challenges of their particular community.  \r\no\tRegional Convenings that bring together HDGs from across the region to build relationships and develop shared strategy\r\n\r\nOur goal is to engage over 500 people in our convenings and work with 12 communities on local economic justice organizing campaigns.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "ROP believes in building an all-inclusive movement where personal relationships, shared struggle, and strategic collaboration build a shared agenda and bigger impact.  The following are several of the most significant collaborations for ROP.\r\n\r\nROP is a founding board member of Causa Immigrant Rights Organization and continues today on the board of directors.  We have a long-term relationship with Basic Rights Oregon.  These relationships allows deep partnerships that anticipate the use of wedges to divide identity groups and more creative, cooperative responses that magnify our collective strength.  For example, when ROP\u2019s hometown was challenged in 2008/2009 with two countywide anti-immigrant ballot measures, BRO and Causa stepped in dedicating huge resources, staff time, and campaign leadership to partner with ROP, eventually defeating both measures.  ROP has worked with BRO on the Our Towns campaign building towards a marriage equality ballot measure.  This spring, we partnered with Causa in coordinating the March for ONE Oregon that brought a 50-passenger bus on a 5 day trip through of Eastern Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, promoting immigration reform in key Congressional Districts.\r\n\r\nAnother collaboration is among organizations committed to preventing Wage Theft in Oregon.  The original members of the coalition are NW Workers Justice Project, PCUN, Oregon Center for Public Policy, Voz, and ROP.  That coalition has grown to over 20 groups and is currently working on legislation in the Oregon Legislature and educating workers on their rights.\r\n\r\nIn addition ROP is an active member of ACT for Justice and Dignity, a network of groups fighting police/ICE collaboration, and with the Rights Working Group.  All of these relationships ensure that ROP\u2019s rural strategies are in line with state and national goals to win victories for immigrants, LGBTQ people, and low-income people in Oregon and across the country.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "While our base has historically been representative of the whitest areas of a state in one of the whitest regions in the country, ROP has created a culture that prioritizes racial justice work and the leadership of organizations of color within the state.  We have developed strategic allied relationships with organizations of color in Oregon, such as CAUSA, PCUN, UNETE, Voz, Center for Intercultural Organizing, and APANO that create accountable and coordinated racial justice work.  Our current work builds on both our strong history of prioritizing racial justice, as well as our historic relationships with CAUSA and PCUN.\r\n\r\nIn the past 4-5 years, our work has begun to incorporate more direct organizing among immigrants and people of color, especially Latinos, in rural Oregon   We have coordinated efforts with our friends at CAUSA and PCUN, and built a Latino organizing program that prioritizes leadership development of rural Latinos and integration of those leaders into ROP\u2019s infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nIn 2008 we hired a bilingual, bicultural staff person with experience organizing rural Latinos.  In 2011 we hired one of the leaders from our Latino Advisory Board. Our number of Latino-led human dignity groups has grown to 6 and ROP hosted our second annual Latino Leadership Retreat in March, 2012 with over 50 participants.  ROP has built a Latino Advisory Board (LAB), and that committee now has two members who cross-over with the Board of Directors.  LAB is playing a key role in our current Strategic Planning process.\r\n\r\nWe have welcomed this internal shift in our membership and leadership, and have dedicated real resources towards not only recruiting and developing leaders of color, but also towards the internal organizational work with our current majority white board, staff and membership.  Through our yearlong strategic planning process, which will conclude in 2013, we have taken time as an organization to delve into potential obstacles and make a plan for how to move to the next organizational phase as a multi-cultural organization.  First steps include incorporating racial justice language into our mission, vision, values statement, formalizing the leadership role of LAB in our organization, recruiting more Latino leaders for a stronger presence on our board, and a dismantling racism workshop that will take place on June 9th with our board, staff, and several dozen key ROP members.  We will continue to flesh out a plan that allows us to do our work engaging white people in racial justice (which has been held up as a national model, including in Chris Crass\u2019 new book \u201cTowards Collective Liberation: Anti-Racist Organizing, Feminist Praxis, and Movement Building Strategy\u201d), as we expand our base to include the growing rural Latino population.\r\n",

MOP's mission is to work for social, racial and economic justice, promoting the dignity and empowerment of people with low- and middle-incomes whose voices have not been heard in their communities. The purpose of MOP is to be an effective force for social and economic justice. Since founding in June 2010, MOP has grown to a statewide organization of 16 formal dues-paying institutional members. \r\nIn our 3 years as a formal organization MOP accomplishments include:\r\n-\tPolicy Victories: In 2011 MOP played a pivotal role in stopping the across the board 10 percent cuts to social programs.  MOP mobilized town hall meetings from Miles City to Bozeman, did a Whistle Stop tour of communities across the Hi-Line, got numerous letters to the editor and op eds published and participated in statewide activities bringing over 300 members to Helena for a day of action.  In 2013 MOP fought and won rate review for health insurance companies, an important victory for keeping care affordable for all.  MOP mobilized 65 citizen lobbyists who advocated for Medicaid Expansion, repealing the Oil and Gas Tax Holiday and a State Bank. \r\n-\tTraining New Leaders: MOP has developed over 100 leaders as effective advocates for change both in Helena and DC. MOP developed leaders through training volunteers on communication tactics, one on ones, and lobbying. \r\n-\tEffective Public Education Campaigns: During the 2012 election MOP registered and educated 3,000 voters on how communities are affected by the state budget. MOP reached voters through meetings and targeted outreach to low-income communities. MOP also released two reports on the lack of living wage jobs in Montana and uses the data when talking about policy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "It is no secret that wealth inequity is an issue. According to MOP's job gap report, 51% of job openings pay less than the living wage for a single adult. 86% pay less that the living wage for a single adult with two children. Even more unjust is the racial wealth gap. Native Americans are the largest non-white demographic at 6.4% of the total population. They make up a disproportionate percentage of those in poverty. Unemployment rates on reservations are greater than 10%. Latinos make up 3% of the population and most live in poverty, often working without benefits and in sub-standard housing. 70,000 Montanans do not have access to health care, yet the legislature refused to accept federal money to expand Medicaid.  Layered on top is the social reality that racism is used to polarize the electorate and move regressive policies.  For example in 2011 the Legislature targeted undocumented Montanans, denying them public services.\r\n\r\nMOP builds its power through organizing.  MOP organizes a diverse set of institutions while also reaching directly into communities to organize impacted families.   Montana organizes a broad base of people in communities not often mobilized, especially in rural areas.  MOP\u2019s organizing and power building process includes doing outreach to impacted communities, bringing in institutions, building community leadership that speaks for itself, creating the opportunity for people to come together and strategize and then mobilize for the change they believe in.  \r\n\r\nIn 2012/2013 MOP is working on: \r\n\r\nImmigration Reform: \r\nUndocumented workers are in the shadows in Montana, yet there is a growing number of immigrants working in agriculture and the service sector.  MOP is promoting activities that focus on \"Keeping Families Together\" and educating non-immigrant communities to change state and federal policies. This organizing surfaced publicly on May 1st, when in the snow over 200 people came together to express their support for immigration reform.  \r\n\r\nHealth Care:\r\nOver 70,000 Montanans do not have access to health care. MOP has a long history of fighting for health care for all.   MOP and Indian Peoples Action a member organization fought together to reauthorize the Indian Health Improvement Act.  Currently our focus is in organizing to force the state to accept the Federal dollars and expand the Medicaid program. \r\n\r\nInvesting in Montana- Building Jobs, social programs and revenue: \r\nWhile Montana has weathered the recession better than most, it is still at risk of gutting key services and programs in favor of tax cuts for corporations. MOP is promoting an alternative vision in the Fair Economy calling for an end of tax breaks for oil corporations in the state, ending corporate loopholes, and investing public funds locally instead of Wall Street. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Building strong statewide leadership committees that drive our organizing: this will be accomplished through board and governance, creating strong committees for Immigration Reform, Health Care, and Investing in Montana. Our committees and board will be strengthened through leadership development and training. \r\n\r\n3. Educating and engaging the public: this will be accomplished by running active, visible campaigns that are led by the people most impacted by the issue. MOP will enter new communities to identify leaders who will work with staff to do educational events that will attract media attention and create a buzz around our issues. \r\n\r\nKnowing whether or not we met our goals will be dependent on MOP creating and executing a strong leadership development campaign that is grounded in relationships, reflection, and action. MOP staff will work with the board and issue committees to provide oversight of our public campaigns, taking time to step back and reflect on what we have accomplished and where we need to go to change the dynamic. ", 
    "narrative5": "MOP participates in multiple partnerships and coalitions to achieve social, economic and racial justice. We aim to work with like minded organizations to add value to the broader movement for justice in Montana as well as to have a greater impact across the state. \r\n\r\nThe Partnership for Montana's Future is a coalition of 30 social justice, labor, and service organizations that believe Montanans deserve strong, safe, and healthy communities, and the opportunity to realize their full potential. We know the best way to achieve that is by making sound investments in our schools, roads, environment, and the other programs and services that make Montana great. MOP is an active member of this coalition, acting as one of the main voices for eastern Montana, small business owners, and people of faith. We engage our members in a more effective manner by utilizing talking points and messaging that comes out of the coalition. \r\n\r\nMOP is a member organization of the Alliance for a Just Society.   A national network of statewide muti-racial organizations.   AJS provides a forum for MOP to participate in national campaigns like immigration reform, national health care and tax reform. \r\nFIRM and Alliance for Citizenship:  MOP is a new member of these two national coalitions that are moving immigration reform from the bottom up.   These national coalitions are moving the Keeping Families Together Campaign working with affiliates to develop immigrant spokes people and create national vehicles for mobilization.  \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Almost 15% of Montana's population is at or below the poverty line and racial wealth gaps exist in all of our communities. A majority of Montanan's communities of color live in the poorest neighborhoods, and many of Montana's reservations are crippled by severe poverty. An organization cannot talk about the issues of economic injustice in Montana without talking about the racial wealth gaps also being created. This is why MOP prioritizes our partners that represent communities of color. \r\n\r\nOne of MOP's founding institutional members is Indian People's Action and we work closely with them to ensure that all issues that MOP work on clearly impact Native American communities. This is evident from our past work with them during health care in talking about the inequity of care through Indian Health Services. \r\n\r\nThis year MOP has seen the need to do education about our broken immigration system to help those Montanans living in the shadows and below the poverty line. While only 1% of those working in Montana are unauthorized there have been very deliberate and targeted attacks against foreign born Montanans over the years. Meanwhile due to the oil boom, foreign workers, many of them Latino, are moving to rural eastern Montana towns to work low wage service sector jobs where they are subjected to racism every day. MOP has begun work with area churches to help with diversity awareness training in these remote areas. \r\n\r\nLegislatures go out of their way to target undocumented Montanans using fear tactics and in 2011 Montana sadly passed a terrible referendum denying services to those without documentation. The passage of this law was due in part to a lack of knowledge and education about the issue of immigration, leading MOP to adopt it as a core issue.  In May MOP coordinated a Rally for Comprehensive Immigration Reform that provided a safe space for undocumented Montanans to share their stories in public, usually for the first time. This happened due to MOP's relationship with Salud y Comunidad, a Latino organization that we will continue to work in coalition with for racial and economic justice. \r\n\r\nMOP is focused on moving the relationships with both Native and Latino communities to outline how they are impacted by current corporate tax policy, this will be through the relationships and trust we have developed within these communities from past work on health equity and immigration reform. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "The Great Recession, years of budget cuts to critical safety net programs, and a deeply regressive tax structure have led to challenging times for Washington residents. High unemployment, the rising numbers of uninsured, and the foreclosure crisis have all had a profound impact on Washingtonians, and particularly people of color.  \r\n\r\nCuts to the Basic Health Plan, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), interpreter services, Disability Lifeline, education, low-income housing, and services for immigrant and refugee communities have further ensured that low-income families and communities of color have borne the brunt of the economic crisis. Due to Washington\u2019s regressive tax structure, our state is not able to raise revenue in fair ways, or to invest in health care, education, job training and other areas that provide opportunity. The result has been an increase in racial disparities and a widening gap between the ultra-wealthy and the poor and middle class.\r\n\r\nWhile our state cuts programs and services to balance the budget, we also lose billions of dollars every year through tax loopholes for large corporations. If the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, we could fix our state budget and make investments in the programs that are needed to achieve equity and opportunity.\r\n\r\nBuilding collective power takes a coordinated and multi-pronged approach. Our organization has a diverse group of community leaders at varying stages of leadership development. Through trainings, community meetings and mobilizations/direct actions we will continue to develop a dedicated base of leaders that work across issues. These activities will engage and inspire people, lead to greater involvement, and help build a strong grassroots movement for economic and racial justice.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Washington CAN! is engaged in policy research and advocacy, multi-issue coalitions, strategic communications and public education and outreach. These strategies supplement our basebuilding work, and ensure that we\u2019re engaging the broader community and media on the issues we\u2019re fighting for. This combination of activities will ensure the collective will and momentum necessary to create a fair and just tax system that meets the needs of all Washingtonians.\r\n\r\nThrough engaging and empowering people who are traditionally marginalized, we can change the power dynamics in our state and build a strong and lasting base of support for economic justice and racial equity. This will solve our continuous deficit problem, and raise the necessary revenue to keep social service programs strong.\r\n\r\nThe public narrative we tell of this fight must focus on values, and push our state to shift from a mantra of \u201cwe\u2019re on our own,\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d This will move us towards the kind of society we want to live in, characterized by race and social justice and equitable opportunities for all.",

The network is a coalition of over 50 organizations working to achieve racial justice through public policy. This coalition produces the annual \u201cFacing Race\u201d report, analyzing the impact of state-level budget and policy decisions on communities of color. Washington CAN! will continue to play a leadership role in these networks, strategically building their capacities, and helping to position them as drivers of a movement for economic and racial justice.\r\n\r\n-Conducting policy research and advocacy: In addition to \u201cFacing Race,\u201d we will release an annual study of the living wage, as well as storybooks featuring personal stories of our members. These research projects, and the advocacy that accompanies them, make the public case for policy change.\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate our work based off metrics analyzing our member engagement (outlined in the chart below), as well as earned media and the success of our coalition work. In addition, the Leadership Council ensures that Washington CAN! leaders are continuously evaluating our strategies and tactics and determining how to move forward. ", 
    "narrative5": "Washington CAN! understands that building coalitions is an essential strategy to achieving social change. We play leadership roles in a range of coalitions on issues of health care access (Healthy Washington Coalition), economic justice (Our Economic Future coalition, Racial Equity Team, Americans for Tax Fairness), racial justice (Facing Race coalition, Race and Social Justice Roundtable) and immigrant rights (Fair Immigration Reform Movement, Caring Across Generations, Immigration Roundtable).\r\n\r\nWashington CAN! convenes the Facing Race network, a coalition of over 50 organizations working together to achieve racial justice through public policy. This coalition produces the annual \u201cFacing Race\u201d report, which analyzes the impact of state-level budget and policy decisions on communities of color. The purpose of the coalition is to create a unified voice on issues of racial equity, and ensure that communities are not pitted against each other in budget decisions. The coalition also works together to create a proactive policy agenda to advance racial equity. Rachael DeCruz, Washington CAN!'s Communications Director, chairs the coalition, with support from Mauricio Ay\u00f3n, Washington CAN!'s Policy Director, and other staff. Washington CAN! is also principally responsible for researching and producing the \"Facing Race\" report.\r\n\r\nWe are applying the same principles of coalition building to our campaign to stop foreclosures. Washington CAN! is creating a broad-based coalition including immigrant, faith, and labor groups. Some organizations involved include United Black Clergy, NAACP, Casa Latina, labor partners, SAFE, Central Area Chamber of Commerce, One America, and the Statewide Poverty Action Network. Washington CAN! convenes the coalition and ensures the campaign is accountable to the needs of the communities who are impacted by this issue.\r\n\r\nWe need a broad and unified movement to effectively challenge power, and we can only achieve that unity if we bring diverse partners together to fight for a common goal.", 
    "narrative6": "Washington CAN! is dedicated to advancing racial justice, and racial equity is addressed at all levels of our organization. Our organizing efforts have always been focused on low and moderate-income communities, yet for much of our organization\u2019s 35-year history, our members were primarily white. We have used this as an opportunity to educate and engage our members as allies in fights against structural inequality and racism.\r\n\r\nFor the past several years, Washington CAN! has intentionally focused organizing efforts in communities of color, and worked to develop leaders that are people of color. In conjunction with this leadership development work, we have recruited people of color as Board members and hired and retained a diverse staff team that reflects the communities where we organize. Now, over half of our core active leaders and our program staff are people of color, and our Board is growing in diversity.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, we believe that all people should have access to prosperity, opportunity, and equal rights and protections under the law. We also believe that a movement for economic and racial justice will be divided and will fail if it is not inclusive of all of our state\u2019s diverse communities.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Washington CAN! incorporates a racial equity lens into all of our campaigns. Our analysis of the problems with the health care system leads with racial disparities in health and barriers to health care access, and our economic justice work is focused around the disproportionate impact that budget cuts have on communities of color. Our campaign against foreclosures leads with race and the impact the crisis has had on communities of color. We also address issues of racial equity through our immigration reform work.\r\n\r\nWe see all forms of oppression as interrelated and acknowledge that all of our struggles are interconnected. For our 2013 Grassroots Action Day we partnered with LGBTQ Allyship (an organization fighting for social and economic justice led by LGBTQ people and allies), and rededicated our energy to supporting issues that affect the LGBTQ community. We also provide anti-oppression trainings to our members as part of our effort to bring people together around a common vision of equity and justice for all.  ",

    "narrative1": "the Service Board was founded in 1995 following the drug-related murder of a young Seattle man, who loved the sport of snowboarding. Those who knew him saw this tragic event as a call to action for the youth of Seattle.  The owners of Snowboard Connection, a local snowboard retailer, joined forces with community members and created tSB as a positive and safe space for Seattle youth. In the ensuing years tSB, grew to be a force for change in Seattle Neighborhoods in need of the most change.  In 2004, the Service Board achieved status as a 501(c)(3) organization. From 2005-2010, growing demand from students, parents and schools led us to launch a second core program, add our Arts in Service summer program, and create our Peer Leader Development Program. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, tSB responded to the economic downturn through an open community discussion to reexamine priorities and budgets. Due to this transparent conversation we were able to streamline services from a neighborhood program model into one All City Program. The consolidation has helped heal traditionally violent neighborhood divisions. In the last year, we have begun to implement our growth plan instituting two new initiatives; the tSB Alumni Initiative and Mentors-for-Mentor, as well as adding new staff. tSB is currently involved in an organizational assessment in order to prepare for further strategic growth and improvement in 2014 and 2015.

    "narrative3": "tSB is a part of an effort to break a cycle of poverty and oppression. tSB youth are dealing with adult problems. Our young people are dealing with loss, disappointment, drugs, violence and cultural barriers. Some are first generation students learning to code-switch and dealing with tremendous expectations. Some are not sure where their next meal is coming from and are helping their families pay rent. Some are babysitting their younger brothers and sisters. Some trying to be comfortable in their bodies and skin but afraid to be themselves. \r\n\r\nWe know that when students don't have models of their potential, when they are unable to imagine a different future for their community, it is more difficult to reach. The youth living in the communities we serve are experiencing higher levels of violence, face larger challenges than communities with more institutional access and are growing up in an American culture that generally does not value youth voice or community.  tSB Mentors participate in additional UIO, adultism and mentorship trainings to learn what it looks like to be an adult ally for our students and help them find access to resources they and their families need.\r\n\r\ntSB works to build understanding of the systems are living in, the power and options they have and give them skills to make change. Within each of our three programs, tSB creates a space where students can find their voice, discover new models of community and power and build the skills that can help them lead change.tSB's curriculum relies on youth leadership (through the Peer Leader program) to facilitate community building, Undoing Institutionalized Oppression workshops, goal setting and service learning over a period of six months. \r\n\r\nAs students learn more about the underlying causes and intersectionalities of the issues that are affecting their communities, they work together to plan service projects to address those issues. This year, students took on violence, gender discrimination, LGBTQ youth homelessness and poverty. They hosted workshops, painted a mural, planned a flash mob and spent a day working at Nicklesville. Students learned new ways to work in groups to plan their projects. They did research about issues they cared about and discovered potential community partners. They learned to ask for donations of space and skills, how to write professional emails and how to follow up with people when they make commitments. They learned valuable lessons about accountability and flexibility when their original plans didn't work out. Upon reflection, they identified ways that they would do things differently and what success meant to them. tSB youth are challenged to become community organizers and leaders in their communities. \r\n",

Weeknight programming incorporates a curriculum plan developed by staff and mentors focused on life skills, art and social justice following a popular education model. Over the course of six months, we develop themes of identity, voice, community, justice and goal setting through intergroup dialogue, guest presentations, teaching artists and reflection. \r\n\r\nOn a typical program night, participants arrive to share a meal prepared by volunteers and their peers. Following dinner we will form a circle and the Program Coordinator or Peer Leaders will introduce the evening\u2019s topic and guests.  The program may include small group break outs for deeper conversation, panels and tools to engage different learning styles. Facilitation is shared between the Coordinator, Peer Leaders and Mentors. At the end of the night, participants end in the large group by sharing gratitude. \r\n\r\nCommunity service projects serve youth by promoting self-empowerment and the ability to create change.

    "narrative1": "The Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice (IMIrJ) formed in late 2006 (as the Oregon New Sanctuary Movement) and is an interfaith coalition of religious leaders, individuals and congregations of immigrants and immigrant allies. We respond actively and publicly to the injustices experienced by our immigrant brothers and sisters in our local communities. We are committed to creating a platform for immigrant voices, working for just and humane immigration policy and the transformation of unjust social and economic policies. Our leadership and volunteers are both undocumented and documented, recent immigrants and immigrant allies, members of faith communities and people of conscience who are not affiliated with a faith community.\r\n\r\n1. Ending Police/ICE Collaboration: IMIrJ is an active member in the ACT for Justice and Dignity network, which seeks to end collaboration between local law enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Through community education and organizing, ACT succeeded in getting the Multnomah County Sheriff's office to change its policy and stop honoring ICE holds in some situations.  IMIrJ volunteers bottomlined the network for the past year and faith leaders played key roles offering public testimony, authoring letters, and participating in actions. \r\n\r\n2. Community Building: Together with Metropolitan Alliance for Common Good and Oregon Dream Activists, IMIrJ worked collaboratively with the Latino community at St. Andrew Church to define their legislative agenda, which included restoration of driver\u2019s licenses and tuition equity for undocumented people. Immigrant members of St. Andrew participated in a lobby day, sharing their personal stories of the impacts of both issues. They made phone calls and sent emails. Both issues passed during this legislative session. However, the biggest win was in organizing this community, which experienced the importance of their voices in making issues visible and making change.",

    "narrative3": "Immigrants in the United States, especially those who are undocumented, suffer multiple human rights violations. Employers exploit them. Sectors of the general public blame them for the country\u2019s economic and social woes and, at times, act out their hate and fears with violence. Social service agencies routinely deny assistance to immigrants. Although there is positive movement in the area of Comprehensive Immigration Reform, the Obama Administration\u2019s strategy has been to focus on immigration enforcement. Over one million immigrants have been deported since 2009, the largest number under any presidency. Local law enforcement agencies engage in racial profiling and collaboration with ICE, while ICE agents persecute and split up immigrant families in raids and detentions. The immigrant detention system is notorious for violations of civil liberties, due process and basic human rights. \r\n\r\nAt the root of these abuses are unjust immigration laws, free trade agreements and structural adjustment policies in a neoliberal model of economic globalization that increases poverty in immigrants\u2019 home countries and lead to forced migration.  Deep seated xenophobia and racism underlie and exacerbate these policies.\r\n\r\nWe focus our work in areas where we can have an impact: in education, accompaniment and policy change. We strive to end oppression of immigrants by (a) building relationships of solidarity and mutuality that break down myths, stereotypes and prejudices among communities; and (b) influencing policy changes at the local, state and national level that respect the dignity and rights of immigrants. We believe that self-interest is a strong motivator leading to the commitment and action of our members.  Self-interest includes the recognition of our interconnectedness and interdependence.  Therefore, we create opportunities for transformative relationships and community building. We know that, through personal connections between immigrants and immigrant allies, our members understand that their self-interest is tied to just and humane immigration policies.  As Dr. King stated, \u201cWhatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\u201d \r\n\r\nOne way we build collective power is by using already organized congregations. Through our interfaith outreach and relationship building, we identify congregations where we have allies. We work with these allies to organize their communities to support the values of immigrant justice and fairness. Communities that have shared values are often willing to listen to stories of injustice and take action accordingly. All faith traditions include the values associated with \u201cwelcoming the stranger.\u201d Using the community and these shared values has provided good organizing opportunities. \r\n\r\nOne of our tasks to achieve our mission is to change public opinion. Faith community involvement also has the advantage of representing a moral authority in the public opinion. We are often asked by our coalition partners for public testimony from faith leaders and participation that includes a faith perspective.",

We will build on the success of changes to ICE detainer policy by getting agreement with the County provide data to evaluate the implementation of policy. We hope use the data for policy improvements. And we will organize our yearly Mother\u2019s Day vigil at the Tacoma Detention Center with our partner organizations from Washington.\r\n\r\nTo achieve our second goal we will grow our base by implementing our new membership model. Our goals are 100 new members, 20 member congregations and 5 congregations with large immigrant membership. We will organize two local experiential delegations about issues faced by immigrants (wage theft, worker justice). To keep our members motivated and improve skills, we will follow-up our anti-oppression training by holding two focused training sessions and adding web resources.\r\n\r\nFor our direct support goal, we will work with our partner organizations to hold three community education events about policy changes. We will respond to changes in immigration law by planning information/assistance about the application process. And we will continue the Immigrant Support Network to provide support for immigrant families affected by deportation.\r\n\r\nWe plan to improve our infrastructure by achieving our fundraising goals, building on our relationships with both national, regional and local policy organizations. We also hope to identify volunteer help to improve our web site and manage social media more effectively.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "One of our strengths as an organization is that we leverage credibility and membership of congregations and with faith leaders as influencers for change. We are also intentional in our coalition building with other organizations that have different and complimentary strengths. We have local, regional and national coalitions that we work with strategically that focus on specific areas:\r\n\r\nLocal and Regional Coalitions:\r\nWe are active members of the ACT for Justice and Dignity Network, the Coalition Against Wage Theft.  Both organizations have specific advocacy goals \u2013 to end police/ICE collaboration and to advocate for policy changes to minimize wage theft. We have two members who are actively involved with the ACT strategy team. And we participate in the Coalition Against Wage Theft \u2019s organizing efforts using our faith leaders and congregations as natural organizing constituents.  Our faith leaders and members have spoken at rallies and have provided testimony for legislative committees. As a result, tuition equity and driver\u2019s card legislation was passed. We support and provide technical assistance of the Oregon DREAM Activists. We continue to develop our relationship with the regional Rural Organizing Project in areas of mutual interest.\r\n\r\nNational Coalitions \r\nOur purpose in developing relationships with national organizations is to keep us informed and active in national issues and strategies. We participate with the Interfaith Immigration Coalition through national conference calls and through personal consulting with their organizers. It is through IIC that we are able to mobilize our members in efforts to advocate for the best outcomes with the federal comprehensive immigration reform. We have a similar relationship with the National Day Labor Organizing Network. We used our relationship with NDLON to support our police/ICE collaboration actions. We developed our local objectives to not comply with ICE detainers based on the national strategy", 
    "narrative6": "We believe that immigration issues are just one thread of a much larger web of injustice: undemocratic governments and corporations that make decisions favoring profit over people, neoliberal economic policies that drive migration, deep-seated racism fueling anti-immigrant sentiment, immigration policies that discriminate against LGBT individuals, and economic injustice that pits low-income workers of diverse race and immigration backgrounds against one another.  All these issues must be addressed if we are to achieve justice in any one of them. IMIrJ is doing our part to unravel this web, in solidarity and cooperation with many other groups and coalitions who share a similarly inclusive vision for social justice. \r\n\r\nWe are very dedicated to be working with and not working for the immigrant community. Structurally, our board is composed of at least half first- or second-generation immigrants. We work in coalition with many different immigrant-led organizations such as Voz, Vecinos en Alerta, the Oregon Dream Activists and Adelante Mujeres. Last year we undertook a comprehensive visioning process where talked with all our stakeholders, including the immigrant led organizations.  We worked closely with the Oregon Dream Activists on the driver\u2019s license issue. We followed ODA's lead in changing some of our policy positions based on their input and input from the larger immigrant community. We worked actively with Oregon Student Association representing the students seeking tuition equity. However, most of our volunteers and faith leaders are white.\r\n\r\nOur board established a strategic intent to directly address the issues of racism and oppression. Our first action in this area was to hold a workshop designed to sensitize participants toward racism and oppression issues. We hired a consultant who has expertise in this area. Fifteen people attended this all-day training. The evaluation of the workshop indicated that participants were exposed to both personal and institutional manifestations of racism and oppression that were new to them. Also, we thought that this training was a good first step but more work was required. We have a team of board members and immigrant allies working on next steps that include: follow-up mini-trainings at our monthly meetings, posting resources on our web site and evaluation of our processes and structures.",

Founded in 2009 by twenty local African American leaders with significant professional experience in advocacy, social services, government affairs, fundraising, economic development, education and health,  PAALF\u2019s mission is to create a network within the African American Community to build power and fight for institutional change in a unified and collaborative way, combatting the divide and conquer that has been created by colonialism, integration, gentrification  and the non profit industrial complex. PAALF convenes African American leaders throughout Oregon to collectively  develop a public policy agenda to eliminate the interrelated disparities the community is experiencing in the areas of housing, economic development, education, health and civic engagement.\r\n\r\nPAALF is guided by a Steering Committee and organized into four subcommittees: Education, Health, Housing & Economic Development and Civic Engagement & Leadership Development. PAALF \u2018s Steering Committee and subcommittees meet once a month and set PAALF\u2019s programmatic, advocacy and policy goals. The Steering Committee commands the fiscal and operational oversight of the organization, and PAALF subcommittees create policy priorities and activities for each fiscal year.\r\n\r\nLast January, PAALF launched the African American Leadership Academy, a year-long cohort program focused on what it means to be a  transformative Black leader and lead with a collective, accountable and social justice mindset. As part of the program, each of our 28 participants attends monthly trainings focused on exploring the strengths of historical Black leaders, is matched with a mentor, has the opportunity to apply for grant funding to do a community based project and upon graduation, is placed into a leadership position either within PAALF or in Portland at large.

    "narrative3": "The issues we experience across a range of topics including education, housing, economic development, health and overall, our ability to be self-determined, are directly connected to the issues of colonialism and racism that Black and Brown communities have been resisting on a global scale for centuries.  However, since the Civil Rights Movement, due to the real and perceived increase in access to American institutions and the American dream, it has been even harder for Black individuals and organizations to understand and address the ongoing oppression we are experiencing. \r\n\r\nPAALF knows that to combat the root causes of colonialism and racism, we must challenge the way the Black community operates and connects with one another and lead with an afrocentric value set, not allowing mainstream values to infiltrate our psyche and analysis. For many years, Portland's Black advocacy community has been led by the \"first and only\" generation, meaning individuals who were the first and sometimes only Black person granted access to their position of influence. This led to isolation, imbalanced focus on individual gain, internalized shame and mistreatment, inability to address issues in a unified and collaborative way and no clear pipeline for emerging community leaders. \r\n\r\nPAALF's African American Leadership Academy (AALA) is focused on filling this disconnect and harnessing the power of the collective. While our entire cohort is similar in the sense that everyone is equally committed to the advancement of African American peoples, through intentional recruitment efforts, we have worked to ensure that they also represented the diversity of what it means to be Black:\r\n- 16  women, 12 men\r\n- 2 identify as being of the African Diaspora, and not African American but African.\r\n- 7 are from the LBGTQ community who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. 1 is transgendered specifically.\r\n- Represent a range of educations levels and socio-economic statuses\r\n\r\nThere are 4 main components of the AALA: \r\nMonthly Trainings\r\nThe central component of the Leadership Academy is monthly trainings focused on providing  participants with concrete skills, a conscious knowledge base and dialogue regarding the state of transformative African American Leadership. \r\n\r\nMentorship \r\nEach participant is matched with an established leader to serve as their mentor and bridge intergenerational disconnect. \r\n\r\nSmall Grant Funding Project Based Learning Opportunity\r\nParticipants can apply for grant funding to develop a community-based project. This year's cohort is enacting a comprehensive plan for addressing gentrification, which includes a policy campaign to address the affects of urban renewal and a youth program, focused on engaging middle schoolers in community visioning. \r\n\r\nAlumnae/i Program\r\nPAALF places each program alumnae/i in leadership opportunities and tracks their involvement to ensure that it is meaningful and that they are being held accountable to advancing a community-driven agenda.

Most recently, over the past twenty years, Portland's Black community has faced much divide and devastation due to gentrification. Because the issues we are experiencing are so grave, we have been operating under much panic. While PAALF continues to operate under a sense of urgency, we also recognize that to be effective in our social change, we must stop and asess where we are going.\r\n\r\nOver the next year, PAALF's overall goal is to become a more inclusive, community-driven network of African American leaders and organizations focused not only on creating another Black organization, but focused on building a movement of Black people. This will include working from within the community and mobilizing Black people from across identities and geographical areas within Portland to develop a comprehensive plan for our direction as a people, including, in the wake of gentrification, exploring whether or not we want to identify a geographic hub for Black people in Portland, not unlike North/Northeast Portland used to be. We will also continue to develop a pipeline for our emerging leaders to be elevated and supported in positions of influence. Lastly, we will focus on developing a comprehensive fundraising plan that seeks revenue from within the community, rather than remain dependent on mainstream foundations. \r\n\r\nOur success in achieving our goals and objectives will be measured by the experiences of our members, which will be evaluated through surveys and case study interviews, as well as our ability to achieve the goals outlined in our policy campaigns. Because we are fighting for cultural change within the Black community and Portland at large, we also know that we will fundamentally feel change if we are doing our work correctly .", 
    "narrative5": "Coalition of Communities of Color:\r\nPAALF is a member of the Coalition of Communities of Color (CCC), a coalition that seeks to unite culturally-diverse community organizations in Portland. In the past, communities of color were pitted against each other to compete for resources. Through the Coalition, communities came together to overcome this competition and develop a single voice. \r\n\r\nThe African American Leadership Academy was developed in direct partnership with the CCC.  In 2010, Meyer Memorial Trust launched an open call to the public to advance a \u201cmillion dollar idea\u201d that could generate improvements in the quality of life for all across Oregon.  The Coalition of Communities of Color (CCC) responded to the call with a message that emphasized the need for leadership development in communities of color. For the past two years, each of the culturally-specific communities in the Coalition have developed their own leadership development program, while remaining unified in our support of one another's programs and overall strategy and identifying opportunities for collaboration and partnership between our cohort members. \r\n \r\nAfrican American Leadership Forum\r\nPAALF is a local affiliate in partnership with African American Leadership Forums in several other cities - the Twin Cities, Seattle, Des Moines, Tacoma, Omaha, Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The forums are currently working together to build a national network of the organization, focused on leveraging local power and wisdom to build a national movement. PAALF has been at the forefront of these conversations and much of the work we are doing in Portland is being elevated and utilized by the other affiliates, including our new organizational structure and the Leadership Academy. Because the issues experienced by African Americans in Portland are directly connected to other Black communities globally, this partnership is providing us the opportunity to address our issues on a Diasporic scale. ", 
    "narrative6": "PAALF is committed to advancing racial justice but is working to elevate a conversation and shift mainstream thinking regarding the ways in which systems of racism are inextricably tied to sexism, classism, homophobia and genderphobia and that these forms of internal oppression in our community are not innate to the African diaspora, but are a product of learned behavior due to colonialism and exposure to western values.\r\n\r\nIn addition to targeted recruitment efforts to ensure our leadership, members  and program participants are representative of the entire African American community, we have launched several initiatives to ensure that we are advancing a dialogue that forces people out of their comfort zones and to confront the various forms of oppressive thinking in our psyches:\r\n\r\nPAALF Intergenerational Forums\r\nIn the Summer of 2013, PAALF launched its intergenerational forum series. Forums are held quarterly with the goal of:\r\n-  Bringing individuals from across generations together to share experiences\r\n-  Cultivating deeper understanding of each generation\u2019s  feelings towards self and other generations \r\n- Promote dialogue and action on issues of classism, sexism, genderphobia and homophobia across and within generations. \r\n\r\nThrough these conversations, PAALF hopes to build a community manifesto, a document that will honor the various experiences within our community and serve as an internal promise to ourselves and others.  \r\n\r\nPAALF Policy Platform\r\nAs PAALF builds its policy platform and new organizational structure, we have worked with leaders from across varying identities to receive their feedback on how the organization can best meet the needs of their particular identity group. We will continue to be transparent and open about our processes, both internal to how we operate and external related to the policies we work to advance, to ensure we are operating from an inclusive standpoint that is aware of the multitude of perspectives from within our community. \r\n\r\nLeadership Academy Curriculum\r\nThe Leadership Academy Program has targeted curriculum on issues of classism, sexism, genderphobia and homophobia in the Black community. This curriculum both elevates the resistance movements led by Black feminists, Black LGBT Leaders and others, while also providing tools for those interested in better understanding how they can be an ally for the issues experienced by those who have been marginalized within our community. \r\n\r\nBlack Male Achievement \r\nThis Spring, PAALF, in conjunction with the City of Portland's Office of Youth Violence Prevention, successfully bid for a technical assistance RFP from the National League of Cities. Through this non-fiscal support, PAALF will convene Black community members to advance the issue of Black male achievement. PAALF is working to ensure that there is a diverse set of stakeholders engaged and that the diversity of Black male perspectives and experiences are addressed through this work.  ",

    "narrative1": "We formed in 1990 when local groups confronting white supremacist activity created a statewide organization.  We continue to be a grassroots, membership-based organization with over 1,800 members and seven local affiliate groups.  Our mission is to promote democratic values and principles, such as pluralism, equality and justice; to challenge bigotry and intolerance; and to organize communities to speak out in support of human rights principles and democratic institutions.  \r\nFrom the beginning, we have worked to identify, train, and mobilize a base of support in a wide variety of civic engagement activities.  For over two decades we have worked to contribute to a safe and inclusive state through organizing and public policy advocacy. Since 2006 we have worked to qualify and pass three proactive ballot issue campaigns.  During this effort we trained over 100 volunteers to gather over 26,000 signatures to place these issues on the ballot.  Since 2010 we have led two successful campaigns to pass local non-discrimination ordinances to protect the LGBT community and are currently engaged in our third effort.  As we executed these local non-discrimination campaigns we identified over 7,000 supporters, trained over 200 volunteers, and mobilized hundreds of people to engage in events and public hearings.  During the 2013 Montana Legislature we worked to engage the LGBT community to finally remove unconstitutional language that criminalized LGB Montanans.  During this effort we brought community members to the Capitol to testify and lobby.  Our biggest grassroots civic engagement effort was in support of expanding Medicaid eligibility to cover 70,000 uninsured Montanans.  We coordinated an effort that trained over 50 volunteers, made over 5,000 volunteer phone calls to voters, identified over 1,500 supportive voters through individual conversations, and through base and ally outreach drove almost 4,000 supportive contacts through the capitol switchboard and legislative webform.

    "narrative3": "Our general civic engagement work addresses a broad range of fundamental unfairness in our state's public policies.  From a lack of basic protections for LGBT people, to economic injustice, to institutional racism the Network's organizing seeks to build power and change policy.  The root causes of these problems stems from a system set up to protect those with privilege whether it be racial, economic, or gender based.  We believe that building collective power is about engaging community members in organizing that builds a shared, multi-issue analysis of social justice that is deeply rooted in human rights principles and values.  The goal of our organizing work is to develop skills and leadership from within our base in order to create an infrastructure of activists that can consistently be mobilized to support proactive issue work or respond to dangerous policy initiatives that seek to undermine our values and our communities.  The Network puts on a variety of educational events and trainings toward the end of developing a shared analysis of our collective work.  Our members and supporters come into our organization in a variety of different ways.  From signing a statement of support for local campaigns, to coming to a film screening on an issue of importance, or attending a lobby day to learn about legislative issues, we have supporters that engage with us because they are interested or affected by an issue.  An enormous part of our work is to make sure that supporters are engaged and offered educational opportunities that move them to understand how our issues and communities intersect, how our experiences are distinct and how they are similar.  To build collective power and achieve social justice victories we have to understand how our struggles relate and how the institutional mechanisms that protect privilege weaken and marginalize our communities.  Because the Network is a multi-issue organization that uses a broad, intersectional, human rights analysis, part of our work to build collective power is recognizing (and helping our members and supporters recognize) when we need to be in a supportive ally role.  We believe that our role as an ally is crucial to building power across the state.  Whether it is responding to a request from tribal leadership to mobilize support of Montanans who are not enrolled members of a tribe to combat anti-Indian organizing, providing reproductive justice trainings to groups who are more comfortable with a reproductive health/rights framework, or being deliberate in advocating for space at coalition tables for representative from communities most affected by a policy, being a respectful and thoughtful ally is crucial.  Building power to change the relations of power in the state of Montana must involve working across constituencies and communities.  ",

    "narrative4": "The Network is seeking funds to maintain and maximize our base's civic engagement work through the 2014 general election cycle.  We are coming off a legislative session where we had incredible engagement from our members and supporters.  As we move forward over the next year, our civic engagement goals involve maintaining the energy and involvement of our existing base and newly identified supporters.  During the 2013 legislative session, we created multiple and varied opportunities for our base to engage in policy advocacy.  Together we achieved some key victories, but the session adjourned without leaving key work unfinished.  The legislature failed to expand eligibility for our state's Medicaid program and also failed to include sexual orientation and gender identity and expression in the Montana Human Rights Act.  The Medicaid expansion legislative campaign was run knowing that we would likely have to continue our effort after the session closed.  Over the coming year we will engage in a coordinated effort to put pressure on our legislature to expand eligibility to cover 70,000 Montanans.  This effort will include reengaging our base and newly identified supporters, forming a ballot committee for a \"citizen's initiative,\" and doing accountability organizing in key communities around the state.  The Network and our allies have a strong preference for successfully pushing a special session that could expand eligibility without delay.  If we fail in that effort we will continue to build infrastructure and organize to win this expansion of eligibility on the 2014 ballot.  Our work to build support and momentum toward non-discrimination protections will take the form of local organizing efforts in Bozeman and Billings.  This organizing seeks to build support for non-discrimination and pass inclusive local ordinances.  We know we have an incredible opportunity to build on the energy and momentum from our legislative organizing.  ", 
    "narrative5": "MHRN participates in a number of coalitions and partnerships because we value collaboration and these activities allow us to work with various constituencies outside of our membership base and across issues.  The Montana Reproductive Rights Coalition is comprised of a number of statewide organizations working to ensure that Montanans have equitable access to a comprehensive range of reproductive healthcare and information on reproductive healthcare.  We collaborate to work on a variety of public policy issues in this coalition.  Our work involves community education, mobilization and policy advocacy.   MHRN's role in this coalition is to bring a reproductive justice framework to the table.  Our work in this coalition allows us to deepen alliances with other organizations, share our analysis, and communicate with our membership in a timely way on policies that affect reproductive justice.  \r\nSince 2007, MHRN has convened an informal alliance of organizations and individuals who are committed to immigrant rights.  This partnership has worked together to leverage limited resources in order to engage in issue education, respond to anti-immigrant policies, and organize collaboratively to build a base of support for immigration policies that align with human rights values.  This partnership has seen great success over the years in defeating anti-immigrant legislation, and has also dealt with significant defeat at the ballot.  MHRN is convening the group again this spring to develop a clear plan to support comprehensive immigration reform in the state.\r\nWe believe that both of these collaborations are reflective of our work to organize across issues and constituencies and develop a base of support for just public policy.  We are committed to bringing an intersectional analysis and human rights values to all of our collaborations, looking for opportunities to share our analysis with other membership organizations, and doing accountability work with organizations when it is necessary.  ", 
    "narrative6": "MHRN uses an intersectional, movement-building framework that centers human rights values in our program work.  We understand that an intersectional and multi-oppression analysis is critical to building a movement for social justice and promoting diverse, safe, and functional communities around Montana.  For that reason, our analysis requires us to examine how communities of color, low-income communities, and other marginalized communities can be disproportionally impacted by public policy and campaigns.  We also understand that organizations can do real harm to communities if they are not thoughtful about who wins and who loses in terms of messages and strategies.  We use common racial justice tools to evaluate both policies that we work on and our message and strategy regarding those policies.  \r\nWhile we are a primarily white organization and play an ally role on racial justice issues, we believe it is critical as a progressive organization to have a clear racial justice analysis.  We're continually working to make sure the leadership of our organization reflects the diversity of Montana, and we continue to offer trainings and educational opportunities on racial justice to people at all levels of our organization.  Our work on the issue of immigration has provided opportunities for expanding the racial justice analysis of our base.  We are currently working with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in an effort to combat anti-Indian organizing that has started around the Bison range and a water compact.  Last election cycle we worked to organize a reproductive justice training for staff and leaders of organizational members of the reproductive rights coalition.  MHRN offers opportunities for our members and allies to participate in trainings that build an intersectional, multi-oppression analysis.  We use curriculum developed by the Western States Center to draw out intersections between communities and showcase the necessity of centering marginalized communities, naming and framing race proactively, and engaging in accountability work as an ally when it is necessary.

    "narrative1": "The Equality State Policy Center\u2019s (ESPC) mission is to work through research, public education, and advocacy to hold state and local governments accountable to the people they represent, and help Wyomingites participate effectively in public policymaking.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1993 as a progressive coalition in a conservative, rural state, the ESPC now has 29 member organizations representing conservation, labor, professional, and other social justice groups. We have three program areas: government accountability, tax and fiscal policy, and Wyoming working people. ESPC provides information and trainings for citizen advocates to boost civic engagement. In 2008, we hired a field organizer to build leadership in native and immigrant communities, intending that those Leadership Councils will mature into independent organizations and coalition members.\r\n\r\nMajor accomplishments include:\r\n* During the 2013 Legislature, we mobilized member agencies and supporters to kill a bill mandating \u201ctip pooling\u201d in service jobs. We also pressured the Governor to veto a change to unemployment law that would have meant workers fired for unintentional, honest mistakes would be unable to get those benefits; the Governor vetoed this bill and his comments on it incorporated ESPC\u2019s language.\r\n* We did voter turnout and education work in advance of the 2012 primary and general elections. Our work on the Wind River Reservation was especially successful, increasing turnout in two precincts by more than 16% (compared to 2008) and garnering significant publicity. \r\n* We have built a statewide network of supporters who we are able to mobilize when needed. This was a major factor in killing the tip pooling bill and getting the Governor to veto the unemployment bill. We use an email alert system; during the 2013 Legislature we sent out nine alerts to an average of 350 recipients each, with an open rate of 34% and an average click-through rate of 13%.",

    "narrative3": "Our work addresses three main areas: tax policy, worker safety/rights, and civic engagement. In Wyoming, the state receives significant income from mineral severance taxes; however, the tax structure does not always provide maximum benefit to the general public. For example, a new rare earth mine is proposed for northeast Wyoming. Currently, the severance tax rate for those minerals is 2%; we want that raised significantly, reflecting the current value of and demand for rare earths. Wyoming has one of the worst records in the U.S. for workplace fatalities, and a high rate of serious workplace accidents. Unscrupulous employers deny discharged workers their final pay; institutional protections fail when county attorneys do not prosecute employers after workers win wage adjudication cases. Wyoming\u2019s minimum wage has been $5.15/hour since 1999; the Federal law covers only two-thirds of Wyoming workers. A 2009 survey showed 8,000 workers in Wyoming make at or below the Federal minimum. \r\n\r\nThe root cause of many of these is Wyoming\u2019s conservative politics, where policy-makers deem extractive and other corporate interests more important than improving the lives of those who are not wealthy or white. Wyoming is a right-to-work state with at-will employment, resulting in unsafe, unfair workplaces, as workers fear for their jobs should they speak out. Immigrant workers often find themselves isolated in the state\u2019s far-flung rural communities.\r\n\r\nWyoming is largely rural and extremely conservative, with a few small cities and large towns. Because of this, many people who would be more active in our work face unique challenges, including a lack of reliable/affordable transportation, fear of losing a job or employer retaliation, social isolation, and language barriers. In Wyoming, merely providing a voice to workers, minorities, immigrants, and low-income people can change some power dynamics.\r\n\r\nBecause much of the media in Wyoming is controlled by a few corporations and/or is extremely conservative, there is very little information readily available to most people on the issues that the ESPC is addressing. For example, a young man was killed recently in an oil field accident; however, the only piece in any newspaper that mentioned this was his obituary in one of the smaller newspapers.\r\n\r\nWe are building collective power among progressive organizations in the state, along with emerging American Indian and Latino/organizations. By working together, we can achieve economies of scale and create a united front to push for policy changes that will benefit our constituents. We identify shared issues of concern, then come together either as formal or ad hoc coalitions. Our board has identified these areas that ESPC will focus on in the next several years as a way to maximize our collective reach and bring together organizations that can attain more as a group than separately.",

Strategies include educating the public through forums, media, and online communication; empowering and mobilizing our supporters to speak out on these issues; and pressuring policymakers on specific solutions. Another important strategy is to provide information to affected people so they can make informed decisions and, in the long term, take an active role in community leadership (e.g., educating their fellow workers, becoming more outspoken on various issues, or even participating more deeply in local or state government).\r\n\r\nWe have a successful multi-channel communication strategy. We use earned media, our web site, and our email alert list to communicate to the general public and to our supporters on specific issues. We use our network of organizations to communicate to the larger progressive community in Wyoming. Through our web site, we disseminate detailed information, such as Fact Sheets and reports. We use the alert list to send calls to action (e.g., contacting a legislator attending a forum or committee meeting), and information, including links to our or other web sites.\r\n\r\nWe will hold public forums around the state on specific topics, testify at legislative committee meetings, mobilize supporters, and reach out to affected populations.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, we have broken our work over the grant year into four areas, with specific goals/objectives and strategies in the chart below.\r\n\r\nWe will track numeric objectives and follow-up with all workshop attendees, particularly immigrant attendees and work with them to organize to use the information to improve safety in their jobs. We will track earned media coverage, online outreach and mobilization numbers. In a state such as Wyoming, policy wins can be difficult to achieve; however, we will also look at feedback from our constituents, member agencies, and supporters.", 
    "narrative5": "In addition to working with ESPC member agencies in our ongoing work, we work in other coalitions. We work with many national and regional organizations on policy issues including: National Employment Law Project on unemployment insurance, minimum wage, and wage theft; Network United for Rural Voice and Cross Network Immigration to address immigration, employment, and health issues from a rural perspective; and National Council for Occupational Safety and Health (NCOSH) on worker safety issues, including Workers Memorial Day commemorations and job safety workshops. These organizations provide technical assistance and information on policy issues.\r\n\r\nFor worker safety, we have a statewide collaboration that includes ESPC, Wyoming Association of Churches, Wyoming State AFL-CIO, Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, and SAFER (Spence Association for Employee Rights). This group held a Know Your Rights workshop in Gillette last fall that more than 40 workers attended, many of them immigrants. With NCOSH, we plan to hold a Worker Safety and Health Training with those workers on June 15. \r\n \r\nIn Wyoming collaborations, we generally take a lead role; however, at times, we provide a conduit to our member agencies or offer policy help.\r\n\r\nAll of our collaborations work across constituency lines. For example, by involving the AFL-CIO and local unions with organizations such as the Association of Churches, which works with immigrants, in worker safety events and activities, we can bring a larger voice to the table than organizations working alone. ESPC has a long-standing collaboration with the Wind River Alliance, to engage American Indian youth in GOTV and other work on the reservation, including voter education and mobilization work in four reservation communities in election years. We also have partnered with the Casper Branch of the NAACP doing voter education and mobilization and citizen engagement work and issue education around Martin Luther King Day.", 
    "narrative6": "In this state, merely providing a voice to workers, minorities, immigrants, and low-income people can change some power dynamics. The ESPC has a long history of working with people of color \u2013 in our Leadership Councils and on the Wind River Reservation \u2013 not to \u201chelp\u201d them but to address institutional problems and assist them in finding their voice. Bringing in minority and low-income organizations and voices to our coalition and to the public discourse will effect change, both in policy and in how some organizations work on those policies.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with our member agency Wyoming Equality on LGBTQ issues. In the 2013 Legislature, we worked with them on domestic partnerships and nondiscrimination legislation. \r\n\r\nThe ESPC is a primarily-white-led organization; however, we have a long history of working with communities of color in the state.\r\n\r\nWe work with people on the Wind River Reservation, including Unity, the Northern Arapaho and the Shoshone tribal liaisons to the Governor\u2019s office, and many others. One project ESPC has been involved with for several years is the Native American Pathways program with the University of Illinois Medical School at Rockford, in partnership with the Kellogg Foundation, to provide ways for Native youth to access health care careers. In addition, we have done extensive voter outreach and education on the reservation, including a very successful drive just over a year ago as part of a contested County Commissioner election that resulted in the re-election of a Native commissioner in Fremont County and our turnout work in 2012 (described above).\r\n\r\nESPC also works with Latino groups in Torrington and Rock Springs. Our long-term plan is for these Leadership Councils to grow into their own entities and join out coalition as full member agencies. Our group in Torrington has addressed discrimination at the local community college, at the local cemetery, and \u2013 this spring \u2013 in a local water and sewer district election. The election was not conducted in compliance with state election law and disenfranchised a number of voters, including Latino voters, resulting in losses by candidates from the Latino community. ESPC connected the group to the Wyoming ACLU and helped collect affidavits and evidence. Candidates and residents of the district filed a petition in the 8th Judicial District Court to challenge the election. The case is pending. \r\n\r\nAll of this work is connected. Discrimination against LGBTQ people or against racial or ethnic minorities or against the working poor is at the core of our policy work. Making government accountable and responsive to everyone is our mission; that cannot happen when there are groups of people who are left out of the policymaking process. \r\n",

The agency has evolved with the needs of the community and now addresses not only the ongoing needs of those affected by HIV/AIDS, but we also provide hepatitis C testing and the first above ground syringe exchange program in Montana. \r\n\r\nIn 2012 we worked with stakeholders to change the name and image of the agency. Our former name, Missoula AIDS Council, was repeatedly identified as a barrier to our ability to connect with our community. Many people reported not feeling comfortable accessing services because they believed we only served people living with AIDS. \r\n\r\nToday our work includes preventing new HIV, hepatitis C and other sexually transmitted infections through testing, education and outreach. In 2012 we conducted 697 free and anonymous HIV tests and 191 hepatitis c tests. One in four people we test for hepatitis C, test positive for the virus. We test at our office as well as several off-site locations including homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, family planning clinics and adult book stores where we target high risk individuals including men who have sex with men and individuals who use injection drugs.\r\n\r\nFor people living with HIV/AIDS, we operate the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program which provides both short and long-term rental assistance and case-management services. We administer this program for seventeen western Montana counties, providing monthly assistance to more than 50 households annually. The HOPWA program currently has a waiting list of 16 people. In addition to housing, we also provide support groups, social activities, monthly dinners, employment training and a pantry in which people living with HIV/AIDS can access personal hygiene and cleaning supplies.\r\n",

Coupled with a 25.8% reactive hepatitis c antibody tests among injection drug users in Missoula in 2012, we believe that the community is in crisis and will realize significant benefit from the adoption of a syringe exchange program. \r\n\r\nA grant of $2,000 in October 2012 from a local Montana foundation allowed Open Aid Alliance to open the first above ground syringe exchange program in the state of Montana. Since March of 2013, we have redirected more than 1,000 used syringes from our community to proper disposal through our syringe exchange program. In addition, we have provided more than 300 new syringes to individuals using injection drugs in our community. We anticipate much greater numbers as word-of-mouth advertising spreads. The usage thus far represents only 5 participants. The National Harm Reduction Coalition is providing capacity building assistance to us as we continue to build and expand our syringe exchange program.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking funding from the Drug Policy Alliance to help us build collective power and challenge the underlying legal implications of operating syringe exchange programs in Montana. We will build collective power by bringing together harm reduction advocates across the state and forming a harm reduction coalition with the specific intention of influencing and changing public policy in order to provide legal syringe exchange programs in the state of Montana.

Basic Rights\u2019 Trans Justice and Racial Justice programs launched in 2009 as part of our current strategic plan, which is designed to develop the leadership and meet the needs of communities that have historically been underrepresented in our movement, especially LGBT people of color, and trans, genderqueer and gender non-conforming people. (\u201cTrans\u201d is an umbrella term that describes people who identify as a different sex than the one they were assigned at birth.)\r\n\r\nBasic Rights\u2019 Trans Justice program works to win policies that increase the safety and wellbeing of transgender Oregonians. Our Racial Justice program builds the leadership of LGBT people of color, creates alliances with organizations and leaders of color, and takes public organizational action as an ally to racial justice efforts in the state.\r\n\r\nBoth programs\u2014rare among mainstream LGBT groups\u2014have helped create a ripple effect nationwide. Most recently, the Racial Justice program built on its public education campaign which centers the lives of LGBT people of color by releasing a video specific to Native American and Two Spirit communities. The program also educates and engages LGBT Oregonians about the importance of key racial justice policies. \r\n\r\nIn November 2012, the Trans Justice program celebrated a first-of-its kind video  featuring eight trans Oregonians sharing stories of health care discrimination. In December, after years of advocacy, Oregon's Insurance Division issued a historic bulletin making Oregon the first state to ban discrimination against trans people in Oregon employers' benefits plans. Both programs have developed a model for community-driven advocacy that\u2019s rarely seen in LGBT advocacy organizations.   \r\n",

    "narrative3": "The Trans Justice program works to win equitable health insurance for transgender Oregonians. Most insurance plans explicitly exclude coverage of basic care for transgender people, denying routine health care that cisgender (non-trans) people rely on every day.  Almost universally, trans people are denied coverage for gender transition. When trans Oregonians cannot access the health care they need, they face increased risk of violence and discrimination. This discrimination creates barriers to change gender markers on identification documents. For trans communities, the impacts of accessing inclusive health care reach well beyond the doctor\u2019s office. Trans youth and trans people of color are especially impacted by these exclusions.   \r\n\r\nThe Racial Justice program seeks to raise the visibility of LGBT families of color and support the leadership of LGBT people of color. Too often, race is used as a wedge issue in political campaigns to divide LGBT communities and communities of color. We believe LGBT people are part of the fabric of communities and families of color, and they face incredible struggles to keep their loved ones and themselves safe. For example: Black and Latino same-sex couples are twice as likely to be raising children as white same-sex couples, yet with less income than other couples.  Unemployment amongst transgender people of color is nearly 30%, twice the rate of unemployment among white transgender communities.  Black transgender people are 40 times more likely than the general population to be HIV positive. The cumulative effects of racism and homophobia/transphobia on LGBT people of color impact nearly every aspect of life.\r\n\r\nThe disparities and discrimination faced by trans communities and LGBT communities of color are not incidental or individual\u2014they are caused by structural racism and homophobia/transphobia. Oregon\u2019s history of systemic racism has created one of the whitest states in the U.S., and one that is often hostile to people of color. Transphobia is pervasive in every community and is enshrined in Oregon statute. Basic Rights works to address systems that create conditions of inequity, and educate our communities and the public about the importance of ending racism, homophobia, and transphobia.  \r\n\r\nWe build power by centering leadership in the communities most impacted by our work. The campaigns we work on are selected and driven by trans people and LGBT people of color. Decision-making is shared among staff members and volunteers.  We maintain accountability to the communities we work in and for through listening sessions to provide feedback on our work, and opportunities to weigh in on strategic decisions.\r\n\r\nOur programs seek to dismantle racism, homophobia, and transphobia by equipping LGBT people of color and trans people with skills to lead our movements, by increasing public education about our communities, and by winning policy change.\r\n",

    "narrative4": "Basic Rights has emerged as a leader amongst statewide LGBT advocacy organizations, resisting conventional wisdom that organizations should only take on established campaigns with large funders.  Instead, we take on a plurality of issues that represent the breadth of experiences in LGBT communities.  While our movement is built to fund mainstream campaigns\u2014like marriage\u2014similar funding sources are only just emerging for trans and racial justice.  As we approach a marriage ballot initiative, Basic Rights is working to ensure that our Racial Justice and Trans Justice programs are financially sustained through and beyond a marriage campaign. As such, a top goal at Basic Rights is to strengthen funding to continue our racial justice and trans justice work.\r\n\r\nThis year, we will increase collaboration between our volunteer leadership teams, Our Families and the Trans Justice Working Group. We will increase groups\u2019 understandings of the connections between racial justice and trans justice by providing three intersectional trainings throughout the year.  We will also train four leaders to co-facilitate workshops about the intersections of oppression; create and implement comprehensive leadership development plans for team members to develop their individual skills; and cross-pollinate our issues and actions to strengthen our organization.  Finally, we will build collaborative power by completing two joint projects. \r\n\r\nAll Basic Rights programs report progress to the Board of Directors quarterly and annually.   Trans Justice and Racial Justice leadership teams create and assess both group and individual goals annually, and revisit and refine plans throughout the year. Creation of individual and group leadership plans can be replicated, so the impact can reach beyond our organization. Currently, we engage fellow LGBT organizations through the Equality Federation to provide training and support in their anti-racist and trans-inclusive practices. As we strengthen our community-led organizing models, we will similarly share best practices with other organizations.  \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Causa, Oregon\u2019s immigrant rights organization: Basic Rights and Causa have worked together for over ten years. Since 2009, Causa and Basic Rights have trained hundreds of staff and volunteers on the intersections between immigrant rights and LGBT rights movements. Last year, the Trans Justice team provided in-depth \u201cTransgender 101\u201d training for CAUSA staff. Basic Rights annually recruits LGBT people of color and trans leaders to Causa\u2019s largest annual mobilization event, their May Day march and rally.\r\n\r\nWe work at the intersections with Causa because immigrant and LGBT Oregonians have been bound together by our experiences of living under laws that say we are less than human. Too often, cross-movement alliances are transactional, reductive and limited, collaborating only on distinct elements of individual projects. This partnership weaves the work together at multiple levels, creating meaningful, accountable and reciprocal alliances for the long-term. We know that true alliances help us win not just policies, but public education, and deep, lasting community investment in one another.\r\n\r\nTransActive Education and Advocacy: TransActive is a leading provider of support, advocacy and medical services to families with gender nonconforming and transgender children. Last year, the Trans Justice program supported TransActive in advocacy which resulted in Oregon\u2019s state Medicaid program covering hormone blockers for trans youth and mental health care for trans people of all ages beginning in October 2014. \r\n\r\nMoving forward, Basic Rights will tackle documentation policies, public health care, and other issues that disproportionately impact trans youth. As we take on the work ahead, we will also work to increase representation of trans youth in leadership positions, ensuring that our work remains accountable to communities most marginalized within the movement, and most impacted by the policies we seek to change. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Basic Rights is committed to taking action for racial justice, both within our LGBT movement, and as an ally to racial justice work led by communities of color.  Our racial justice work operates through ongoing internal organizational development; developing the leadership of LGBT people of color; strong, accountable partnerships with community organizations; and moving white LGBT people to action on racial justice issues.  Our work toward racial justice can raise the visibility of LGBT families of color and deepen alliances between racial justice and LGBT rights movements.\r\n\r\nOrganizational development: Basic Rights continues to undergo internal organizational development on anti-racism and trans inclusion. Since 2006, these processes have included assessing our internal policies and practices; creating detailed work plans that lift up the integration of racial justice, trans justice and youth inclusion in all of our programs; changing organizational policies and practices to reflect our anti-racist and trans justice values; and requiring staff and board to regularly attend anti-racism and trans-inclusion trainings.\r\n\r\nLeadership development:  Our Racial Justice and Trans Justice programs are structured to centralize the leadership of LGBT people of color and trans people. This October, we will hold our third annual Trans Justice Summit to develop 40 new trans leaders\u2019 organizing skills. Staff and volunteer leaders will provide trainings on policymaker education, the intersections of immigrant rights and trans rights movement, increasing access to transition-related care under the Oregon Health Plan (OHP), and more. Recruitment will focus on trans people who are on OHP, especially trans people of color and trans youth. The Racial Justice and Trans Justice programs will partner on trainings, recruitment, and more.\r\n\r\nCommunity partnerships: Within our partnerships, we strive to develop replicable models for intersectional work to strengthen work for racial justice and LGBT equality nationwide. Basic Rights has worked extensively with Western States Center to deepen and structure these partnerships. From one-on-one meetings with more than 45 straight and LGBT leaders of color in 2009 to collaborating on the launch of our Racial Justice program, this partnership has deeply strengthened our work. \r\n\r\nEducating & engaging allies: Basic Rights systemically engages white folks in conversations about racial justice at every level. In our phone bank trainings for the freedom to marry, we explain how white LGBT people often appropriate \u201ccivil rights\u201d language, and the impact on communities of color. In our education on trans-inclusive health care, we highlight experiences trans people of color, illustrating the impacts of racism and transphobia. Volunteers and staff from across the organization take action for racial justice by attending events such as Causa\u2019s May Day rally. We also develop interactive workshops educate our predominantly white, cisgender supporters about the intersections of gay rights, trans justice, racial justice, labor and more. \r\n",

IPA was formed to fight for equity and to preserve the rights of Native Americans in urban towns and the border towns at the edge of the seven Indian reservations.  IPA works to achieve its mission by training and developing low-income Native American leaders, working to build strong coalitions and partnering with tribes and other native organizations. In addition, IPA uses participatory research and communications to get its message out.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n*IPA has strong relationships on the reservations Crow, Fort Belknap and Northern Cheyenne. IPA partners to extend its reach and address issues of discrimination.\r\n\r\n*Participatory Research includes \"Addressing Racial Profiling: To Protect and Serve? Unequal Treatment in the Billings Police Department\" October 24, 2005. A study conducted by the IPA reveals problems within the police department that lead to distrust and fear among residents. Last year, IPA collected 11 stories and published a storybook, \"Is Help on the Way?\" Native American Stories about the Ambulance Service in Hardin.\r\n*Building and participating in coalitions. IPA played a key role in Montana's fight for health care (Health Care for American Now -- Montana). IPA brought the perspective of native people to the tale and fought and was part of winning the Affordable Care Act, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and addressing health inequities.\r\n*IPA runs local issues campaigns -- for example through listening sessions IPA uncovered ambulance abuse cases in Hardin, MT. Through the listening sessions, leaders were identified and developed.

The foundational leadership program is a 24-month fellowship that provides culturally based training, resources, and a community of support; to help young Native leaders create positive change in their communities. NYLA connects education to action, and was created in 2009 by and for students at Tribal Colleges, which serve low-resourced, predominantly rural reservation communities. \r\n\r\nNYLA's approach to culturally-based leadership development and organizing as rooted in indigenous values and ways of life, and does not translate fully to mainstream forms of organizing.   Please see Monica Nuvamsa's explanation of culturally based organizing in the Injunuity 'Turtle Island' episode for more. http://www.injunuity.org/#!/show  \r\n\r\nEach year, NYLA recruits at least 10 Native young people (between the ages of 22 and 32), primarily from Tribal Colleges in five states (MT, SD, WA, AZ, NM), to participate in a 24-month fellowship program focused on building individual and collective leadership skills, and supporting fellows to complete community-based development plans. NYLA is focusing expansion in the Northwest, specifically in Washington and Montana. The NYLA Fellow network has expanded from 2 to 12 fellows in the Northwest since 2009.  In Montana there are 5 NYLA Fellows, 7 in Washington.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, NYLA fellows focus their community organizing on issues including: Environmental Justice, Civic Engagement, Reviving Cultural Traditions and Language, Economic Development, Youth Development and Organizing, Education, Health and Wellness, Arts and Media, Community Healing, and Two-Spirit/LGBTQ Community-building.\r\n\r\nWithin each state of operation, NYLA builds relationships at the community level, including those engaged in community organizing, Tribal policy, youth leadership, education reform, health care, and local government, and more. These partnerships form the network through which NYLA fellows receive guidance and long-term mentorship in future employment opportunities.",

While Native communities face many severe poverty indicators, NYLA focuses on the assets and strengths of Native communities: Cultural values, meaningful traditions, and strong intergenerational relationships.\r\n\r\nNative communities, and Native young people in particular, experience segregation and isolation in very unique ways as members of sovereign nations trying to build bridges to non-Native communities, even to other communities of color.\r\n\r\nBy empowering NYLA fellows to be young change makers in Native communities, they are able to preserve traditional culture and language, but also to share and integrate this unique cultural knowledge into broader society. Through economic and educational partnership, NYLA fellows will serve as models for their generation of Native youth: Preserving tradition, while also becoming leaders and innovators in their own communities and broader society. \r\n\r\nSelected statistics on Native American communities:\r\n\r\n>>At Tribal Colleges and Universities, entering students have family incomes that average $13,998, or 27 percent below the poverty threshold. Factors such as geographic isolation, limited opportunities in rural areas and on reservations, and low labor force participation rates contribute to a continuous poverty cycle.*\r\n\r\n>>Demographics in Native communities are trending younger.  As exemplified on the Oglala Lakota Nation, it is estimated that by 2020 over half the population will be under the age of 18. Despite these inevitable shifts, many Tribal Nations do not have the resources or capacity to engage the full potential of their youth population. As such, many Native youth lack the necessary skills to advance their education, organizing skills, employment and other opportunities in a long-term way. \r\n\r\nWithin this difficult context and lack of resources for Native young people, NYLA uses a culturally based curriculum developed directly from fellows\u2019 experiences. NYLA\u2019s leadership model is strength-based and focuses on the resiliency of each person and culture, and their ability to create social change in their communities.\r\n\r\nNYLA is strengthening collective power by beginning with individuals, by building their capacity and skills to develop collaborative leadership networks with their peers and elders. Many young leaders are often isolated in choosing sobriety, staying rooted in traditional values and organizing for community change. Many NYLA communities are suffering from brain drain, where many talented leaders have moved off the reservation to pursue economic and other opportunities.  NYLA seeks to support young leaders who are ready for intensive growth and are committed to staying in their communities for the long-term.  The NYLA Leadership and Campaign Action plans are spefically for capacity building for the NYLA members and their communities to achieve and sustain long-term change.  \r\n",

    "narrative6": "Indigenous communities experience compounded forms of oppression, internally from lasting effects of colonialism and the forced assimilation process, and from broader society due to systemic barriers and active forces to undermine and challenge sovereignty rights. NYLA intentionally chooses a holistic approach to community change, where our members focus on the many facets of undoing oppressive structures and strengthening their community capacity for sustained development.\r\n\r\nNYLA by its very creation embodies the values of self-determination for indigenous communities. Founding members chose to create their own space where the needs of their communities could be addressed through culturally-relevant, grassroots-driven development strategies. Although all NYLA members are Native, there is a great diversity among Tribal cultures. NYLA is beginning first to strengthen relationships across isolated Tribal communities through the passion and vision of young leaders. These young leaders are supported to vision beyond short-term survival needs to help lead their communities forward.  \r\n\r\nNYLA will utilize this investment for seed funding for fellows' NYLA Individual Leadership and Community Organizing Plans.  In the second phase of the NYLA fellowship, young leaders develop goals and strategic plans for their organizing work.  As a culturally-based organization, NYLA supports for long-term sustainable community change.  To ensure community actions are sustainable, fellows develop goals that support a foundation of personal balance (emotional, physical, spiritual, mental); academic achievement and ultimately community action.  Fellows receive at least 60 hours of training, mentorship, leadership coaching and peer support for the development of these plans.  After fellows complete their plans they submit to NYLA Co-Directors for final review, along with a budget and fundraising plan.  NYLA fellow seed funding will be utilized as leverage for additional funds to be raised from local communities and grassroots fundraising.  Fellows will have the option to combine their resources for collaboration.\r\n\r\nAll Montana fellows are connected to Salish Kootenai College either as graduates, currently enrolled in degree programs or in the enrollment process.

    "narrative1": "We formed in 1990 when local groups confronting white supremacist activity created a statewide organization.  We continue to be a grassroots, membership-based organization with over 1,800 members and seven local affiliate groups.  Our mission is to promote democratic values and principles, such as pluralism, equality and justice; to challenge bigotry and intolerance; and to organize communities to speak out in support of human rights principles and democratic institutions.  \r\nFrom the beginning, we have worked to identify, train, and mobilize a base of support in a wide variety of civic engagement activities.  For over two decades we have worked to contribute to a safe and inclusive state through organizing and public policy advocacy. Since 2006 we have worked to qualify and pass three proactive ballot issue campaigns.  During this effort we trained over 100 volunteers to gather over 26,000 signatures to place these issues on the ballot.  Since 2010 we have led two successful campaigns to pass local non-discrimination ordinances to protect the LGBT community and are currently engaged in our third effort.  As we executed these local non-discrimination campaigns we identified over 7,000 supporters, trained over 200 volunteers, and mobilized hundreds of people to engage in events and public hearings.  During the 2013 Montana Legislature we worked to engage a wide variety of Montanans to eliminate the death penalty.  During this effort we helped to bring faith leaders, family members, and supporters to the Capitol to testify and lobby.  Our biggest grassroots civic engagement effort was in support of expanding Medicaid eligibility to cover 70,000 uninsured Montanans.  We coordinated an effort that trained over 50 volunteers, made over 5,000 volunteer phone calls to voters, identified over 1,500 supportive voters through individual conversations, and through base and ally outreach drove almost 4,000 supportive contacts through the capitol switchboard and legislative webform.

    "narrative3": "Our exploration of expanded work on criminal justice will be part of our general civic engagement program.  This work addresses a broad range of fundamental unfairness in our state's public policies.  It has become clear through letters we receive from people who are incarcerated and testimony that we have witnessed at interim legislative committee hearings, that our state's criminal justice system is unfair and broken.  Even minor infractions can cause devastating, long term affects on the lives of people who have been incarcerated and their families. Over the last five years our civic engagement work has included issue education, leadership development, and grassroots mobilization toward eliminating the death penalty in Montana.  In order to create a path to more expansive and comprehensive work on criminal justice reforms, we will need to engage these individuals as well as identify and create meaningful opportunities to engage with individuals who have direct experience with the justice system in Montana.  We believe that building collective power is about engaging community members in organizing that builds a shared, multi-issue analysis of social justice that is deeply rooted in human rights principles and values.  The goal of our organizing work is to develop skills and leadership from within our base in order to create an infrastructure of activists that can consistently be mobilized to support proactive issue work or respond to dangerous policy initiatives that seek to undermine our values and our communities. Our members and supporters come into our organization in a variety of ways.  From signing a statement of support for local campaigns, to coming to a film screening on an issue of importance, or attending a lobby day to learn about legislative issues, we have supporters that engage with us because they are interested or affected by an issue.  An enormous part of our work is to make sure that supporters are engaged and offered educational opportunities that move them to understand how our issues and communities intersect, how our experiences are distinct and how they are similar.  To build collective power and achieve social justice victories we have to understand how our struggles relate and how the institutional mechanisms that protect privilege weaken and marginalize our communities.  Because the Network is a multi-issue organization that uses a broad, intersectional, human rights analysis, part of our work to build collective power is recognizing (and helping our members and supporters recognize) when we need to be in a supportive ally role.  We believe that our role as an ally is crucial to building power across the state.  In order to effectively organize around criminal justice reform, we'll need to engage our base and create a thoughtful plan to engage those who are directly affected.  ",

Currently when we receive calls asking for help navigating the system or mail from people who are incarcerated, we don't have the ability to help them.  We can send people to the public defenders office or the ACLU, but we know that these entities probably won't be able to offer help.  All members of the Abolition Coalition recognize the need for broader work in this area and with some resources the Network can begin to assess each organization's ability to expand the work, identify other key groups that should be engaged, and begin to organize around demanding that our criminal justice system recognizes, respects, and protects human rights principles.  We would start by engaging likely allies and assessing their knowledge and commitment.  We will engage in a research effort to identify individuals and families who have shared their experience on the public record during hearings and meetings and try to set up initial one on ones to understand their experience and the barriers they faced.  We'll do outreach to local groups that help the families of individuals who are incarcerated navigate the system.  We'll assess the results of this research and outreach in order to develop a clear and achievable plan to engage in base building activities that mobilize allies and work to identify and build leadership from individuals and families who are most directly affected.  To achieve this, members of the Abolition Coalition and other key allies will have to commit to joint fundraising activities to raise additional resources for the effort.  ", 
    "narrative5": "MHRN participates in a number of coalitions and partnerships because we value collaboration and these activities allow us to work with various constituencies outside of our membership base and across issues.  The Montana Reproductive Rights Coalition is comprised of a number of statewide organizations working to ensure that Montanans have equitable access to a comprehensive range of reproductive healthcare and information on reproductive healthcare.  We collaborate to work on a variety of public policy issues in this coalition.  Our work involves community education, mobilization and policy advocacy.   MHRN's role in this coalition is to bring a reproductive justice framework to the table.  Our work in this coalition allows us to deepen alliances with other organizations, share our analysis, and communicate with our membership in a timely way on policies that affect reproductive justice.  \r\nThe Network is a founding member of the Abolition Coalition.  This coalition organizes collectively toward the goal of ending the death penalty in Montana.  Within this coalition the Network's role has been to identify and mobilize supporters within our base on this issue. Another key role we play is to continually push the coalition to use a racial justice lens in the work.  This has involved looking at disparate sentencing in the state and centering the voices and experiences of people of color in public education programs.  \r\nWe believe that both of these collaborations are reflective of our work to organize across issues and constituencies and develop a base of support for just public policy.  We are committed to bringing an intersectional analysis and human rights values to all of our collaborations, looking for opportunities to share our analysis with other membership organizations, and doing accountability work with organizations when it is necessary.  ", 
    "narrative6": "MHRN uses an intersectional, movement-building framework that centers human rights values in our program work.  We understand that an intersectional and multi-oppression analysis is critical to building a movement for social justice and promoting diverse, safe, and functional communities around Montana.  For that reason, our analysis requires us to examine how communities of color, low-income communities, and other marginalized communities can be disproportionally impacted by public policy and campaigns.  We also understand that organizations can do real harm to communities if they are not thoughtful about who wins and who loses in terms of messages and strategies.  We use common racial justice tools to evaluate both policies that we work on and our message and strategy regarding those policies.  \r\nWhile we are a primarily white organization and play an ally role on racial justice issues, we believe it is critical as a progressive organization to have a clear racial justice analysis.  We're continually working to make sure the leadership of our organization reflects the diversity of Montana, and we continue to offer trainings and educational opportunities on racial justice to people at all levels of our organization.  Our work on the issue of immigration has provided opportunities for expanding the racial justice analysis of our base.  We are currently working with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in an effort to combat anti-Indian organizing that has started around the Bison range and a water compact.  Last election cycle we worked to organize a reproductive justice training for staff and leaders of organizational members of the reproductive rights coalition.  MHRN offers opportunities for our members and allies to participate in trainings that build an intersectional, multi-oppression analysis.  We use curriculum developed by the Western States Center to draw out intersections between communities and showcase the necessity of centering marginalized communities, naming and framing race proactively, and engaging in accountability work as an ally when it is necessary.

We will work with organizations and entities that deal with the criminal justice system and engage in policy research to inform a way forward on organizing and advocacy.

    "narrative1": "Organizational Background: Partnership for Safety and Justice is a multi-faceted, statewide advocacy organization based in Portland, Oregon. PSJ was founded in 1999, and we have developed a pioneering and provocative model that works with all of those most directly affected by crime, violence and the criminal justice system (survivors of crime, people convicted of crime, and the families of both) to advocate for approaches to public safety that are more just and that effectively build safer and healthier communities. This approach offers a holistic perspective on needed system change and a valuable strategy for shifting Oregon towards more effective, prevention-based approaches to addressing crime.\r\n\r\nOur Goals: \r\n\r\n1.\tA reduction in the over-reliance on incarceration as a response to social problems; \r\n2.\tA redirection of public resources away from less effective and more costly approaches to public safety (incarceration) toward public services that can build strong, safe communities (education and human services) and prevent future violence and crime;\r\n3.\tIncreased community services and support for survivors of crime and violence; and\r\n4.\tA reduction or elimination of the ways Oregon treats youth as adults within the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of major accomplishments: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn 2011, PSJ was central in the passage of HB 2707. The Safe Kids, Safer Communities Act changes the default placement of youth charged as adults being held pre-trial to juvenile facilities in order to keep youth out of adult jails. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tPSJ was heavily involved in passing a landmark omnibus corrections savings law in 2009 (The Safety and Savings Act). The Act included a range of sentencing reforms that saved roughly $50 million in reduced need for prison beds and reinvested those savings into smarter approaches to public safety. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "PROBLEM: Oregon\u2019s criminal justice system is focused on incarceration as the primary strategy to create and maintain public safety. This is the most expensive and the least effective approach to creating public safety and this imbalance has resulted in a wide range of negative consequences for which communities of color and low-income communities have disproportionately suffered the brunt. The state has been on a serious prison build up over the past 15 years \u2013 creating a resource shift of public dollars away from critical services like healthcare, human services, and higher education.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM: The state currently treats juveniles in some instances as adults in the criminal justice system. A wide variety of research suggests that these policies are both an ineffective approach to public safety and also threatens the future success of those youth.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM: A small number of reactionary crime victim advocates have created a powerful and unrepresentative voice in promoting \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d policies; meanwhile, the real interests of crime survivors are somewhat ignored with existing community-based and system-based support services for crime survivors receiving largely inadequate resources to meet the need.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that structural racism underlies and drives criminal justice policies in the U.S. and we are committed to prioritizing work that engages and serves communities of color that are disproportionately affected by both crime and over-incarceration.\r\n\r\nWe believe that in order to build the necessary power to create change, we need to grow the number of effective grassroots advocates who feel both empowered as individuals and who also understand the need to exercise collective power. We are very intentional about building the skills and involvement of our members so they can become more effective social change advocates. There are a variety of ways we do this. We organize Action Teams that meet almost monthly as a space to develop community, increase the issue knowledge and organizing skills of our members, and to gather feedback on strategies and programs. We have Action Teams in Portland, Salem, and Eugene.\r\n\r\nWe also regularly present trainings that range from how to effectively engage your family, friends, and neighbors, how to write a successful letter to the editor, understanding the state budget, to how to build a relationship with your legislator. These trainings are integrated into Action Team meetings, our annual statewide gathering, Lobby Days and stand-alone events. We also look to create special opportunities for members who have the potential to step into more public roles like: speaking with the media, testifying at hearings, and representing PSJ at key convenings, conferences or coalitions.\r\n",

We are working hard to pass a package of sensible sentencing reforms that would flatline prison growth over the next decade and invest some of the savings into more cost-effective and prevention-oriented public safety strategies; strategies that help people re-build their lives like addiction treatment, mental health programs, victim services, and re-entry programs. We also hope to pass a bill that would mitigate the way Oregon\u2019s mandatory minimums automatically treat youth as adults.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it has taken us years of organizing to get to this point. We are not yet sure if we will succeed in the coming weeks. If we do, we will have to vigorously defend the victory because we have opposition that could look to refer the legislation to the ballot or repeal pieces in the 2014 legislative session. Of course, if we don\u2019t succeed, we will need to step back, take stock, and refocus our work.\r\n\r\nSo describing what our work will look like over the next year is very difficult to do. Here are several core strategies that will be unlikely to change.\r\n\r\nSampling of Key strategies:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIncrease strategic concentrations of educated and active grassroots advocates in key locations\r\n\u2022\tIncrease and sustain legislative champions for sentencing reform and justice reinvestment\r\n\u2022\tBuild a powerful and active coalition of groups and individuals to help advocate for justice reinvestment: the Oregon Coalition for Safety and Savings\r\n\u2022\tIncrease media coverage of our issues with supportive frames\r\n\u2022\tDisseminate material that highlights ways in which communities of color are disproportionately impacted by the justice system and promote solutions \r\n\u2022\tMake presentations and disseminate materials among victim advocates and organizations about the benefits of a justice reinvestment framework\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Although PSJ\u2019s core goals are focused on criminal justice reform, we consider ourselves a movement-building organization. It is important to note that we are reaching people not already connected to progressive political work. Our membership has many people for whom their first politicizing moment came with their engagement with the criminal justice system. We make it our job to further people\u2019s politicization by making connections between other issues and communities. As a movement-building organization we must balance the goals of building our organization and advancing our mission and agenda with serving as useful allies in other areas of critical social justice work. We take the ally role very seriously and intentionally seek opportunities to support the struggle for gender justice, immigrant rights, equity for the LGBT community, and other critical movements. \r\n\r\nAlso to advance our own goals, a core strategy of ours is to build coalitions and alliances with other groups and organizations that support our policy goals and can amplify our messages and power. It is very difficult for just one grassroots organization to make very serious statewide change happen on its own. we staff a powerful and effective coalition called the Oregon Coalition for Safety and Savings. The coalition has allowed us to broaden our base and collaborate with some groups much more powerful than us. The coalition includes groups like SEIU, the Oregon Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, the Oregon Student Association, the Human Services Coalition of Oregon, and many others.\r\n\r\nWe are also engaged in a collaborative project to create a racial equity legislative report card.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "We talk earlier in the proposal on how we consider ourselves part of a larger movement. We work in a range of ways with groups working for LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights, economic justice, and other oppressions.\r\n\r\nIn regard to racial justice, we use a race lens to inform our external and internal work and make sure that core elements of our goals are designed to explicitly create racial justice. For example, we are actively working to pass racial impact statement legislation. This bill would create racial impact statements for criminal justice and child welfare bills. This tool would help identify proposed legislation that could increase institutionalized racism.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "SAFE was formed on May 1st of 2012 after activists from Seattle attended a City Life/Vida Urbana training because hundreds of Seattle families are losing their homes every month to foreclosure and bank eviction.  This environment is unconscionable. Coming out of the Occupy movement, many local activists came to the realization that the mass displacement of the foreclosure crisis was the tangible way Wall Street was harming our communities. The number one issue confronting working people, women, and people of color in South Seattle was housing.  We set out to organize a community to fight back in a tangible way against foreclosures, bank evictions, and a toxic system that imposes this crisis on us.  In its first year, SAFE has successfully prevented the eviction of six families directly, of Tongan, Somalian, African-American, Vietnamese, Mexican, and European backgrounds through public protest.  SAFE has also connected dozens of families with pro bono legal services, as well as freely given advice and inspiration.  \r\n\r\nFor many facing foreclosure, SAFE has been a vehicle for turning undeserved shame into a culture of defiance and resistance, helping create new activists and community leaders who then assist and inspire others facing a common struggle.  Women especially, who have been told by society and people around them not to be public advocates, not to be loud, powerful and \"demanding\" in public settings, are people that lead our movement.  SAFE has been featured in a variety of media outlets from Real Change (a newspaper of, by and for the houseless community) to Komo 4/King 5 news and The Stranger.  This isn't simply to promote our organization and name, but to promote the notion that we can fight to stay in our homes, that we don't have to \u201cself-evict\u201d just because a bank sent us intimidating letters in the mail.",

We raise our voice against the immense political and \u201clegal\u201d powers of financial institutions that claim a right to displace SAFE members and all families in foreclosure.  The Wall Street banks drove the economy into the ground and took taxpayer bailouts because they were supposedly \"too big to fail.\" SAFE members just want to negotiate fair and rational settlements with the banks to stay in their homes. Why will the banks not negotiate?\r\n\r\nWe are opposed to an unregulated casino financial system that put profits before human interests.  In our view, until housing is no longer a commodity, but rather a human right, this crisis will continue.  As long as the problems of unemployment, declining wages, alienation, fear, a broken justice system, a profit-driven healthcare system, racism, sexism, the erosion of hard-won civil liberties, money dominating politics, and the ecology being sacrificed on the alter of economic growth are left unchecked, the crisis will continue. \r\n\r\nWe confront the imposition of shame by banks, courts, and corporate media onto our members, we turn this totally undeserved shame into a culture of defiance/resistance and throw it back towards the institutions and people who are actually responsible.  Families facing foreclosure and eviction tell their stories loudly and publicly, thus helping to destigmatize being in foreclosure as some kind of taboo topic, something to hide and be embarrassed about.  As more and more people speak openly about being in foreclosure and people in the wider public become more aware and sympathetic, the ability to throw people like Dana Ventura out of their homes is weakened.\r\n\r\nSAFE employs the dynamic organizing model perfected by City Life in Boston over the last six years. We use a Defensive and Offensive strategy. The Defense is knowing your legal rights and defending yourself legally. This Defense is used together with the Offense. The Offense is public protest and public pressure on the banks. We are building a radical base that fights to save individual homes while generating a movement to change the whole society. \r\n\r\nSAFE is part of a broader international social justice movement for basic human needs such as clean water. Community leaders have and will continue to spring up, forged in struggle.  Lives of individuals are changed as we fight to change the system.  As victories are won, more and more people will be empowered to fight back, to stay in their homes, and not give up hope. The power of big money will wither away and the power of the \"bank tenants\u201d and their communities will grow.",

SAFE's targeted outreach to families most affected is building a base strong enough to make it happen and our goals are supported by a local coalition led by WA CAN.  SAFE will continue direct action campaigns that win victories for individual families and inspire other families to come forward and fight to stay in their own homes. We turn a culture of shame and \"self-eviction\" into a culture of resistance and defiance. \r\n\r\nOur key strategy is to continue outreach, education, and empowerment of those hardest hit. The true leaders of this movement are the specific families empowered to publicly take a stand against their displacement.  The BTA model designed by City Life gives us a framework to support this leadership with our Defensive and Offensive components. SAFE should be partnering with Harvard Legal Aid, City Life, and other organizations to broaden our legal support with cooperation from Seattle University's Access to Justice Institute and other progressive supporters in the near future. Meanwhile, SAFE's elected grassroots Organizers will continue to plan dynamic direct actions to publicly pressure the banks to negotiate.\r\n\r\nWe will measure SAFE's success based upon the growth of our weekly general meetings and comparing our success this year with the success of last year. Preventing the eviction of 12 new families through direct action and hosting weekly general meetings with more than 80 people in attendance would show that we have doubled our success. Half of these numbers would show that we have maintained our success from last year. A decline would show that we have to completely reevaluate our strategy.", 
    "narrative5": "SAFE is a member of Right to the City National Alliance (RTTC), which is a network of radical base-building organizations across the country.  We participate in coordinated days of action with RTTC similar to the national \"Homes for All\" day of action in mid-March when we called for an end to bank evictions over I-5 with lighted banners shared with SAFE by Vashon Island-based Backbone Campaign.\r\n\r\nOur organization is also part of Washington CAN's Resist coalition, which is working locally and at the state level to call for political change.  In Seattle, SAFE has led the charge using direct action to confront the issue and bring it to the fore. SAFE is hosted by Bethany UCC, a radical social justice ministry of Rev. Angela Ying on South Central Beacon Hill.  Immigrants are a big part of SAFE and the lack of basic rights many immigrants face makes them targets for fraud.  We participated in the March for Immigrant and Workers rights organized by El Comite on May Day.  SAFE views itself as a part of the labor movement, \u201ca union at home\u201d, and especially the environmental movement, as we work to build more resilient, interdependent, and sustainable communities.\r\n\r\nThough SAFE as an organization does not endorse political parties or candidates, we welcome the participation of all people and organizations as long as they don't violate our foundational principles, and encourage local politicians to get involved on the side of the people. So far the Socialist Alternative Party under the campaign of Kshama Sawant for City Council have been very supportive.  As an organization, SAFE has been inspired and informed by City Life's work in Boston.  We continue to communicate closely with them in our common struggle and have been highly recommended by Steve Meacham, a nationally recognized political organizer.", 
    "narrative6": "SAFE struggles for economic justice, environmental justice, housing justice, for liveable communities, and confronting problems that disproportionately affect women and people of color.  We believe it is important that any struggle to confront an injustice in a particular community should reflect the diversity of that community.  No matter what goes on in the halls of power and what race the president may be, without economic justice for poor and working people, disparities created by centuries of racism will never go away.  Even if another racial slur was never uttered and racist thoughts and feeling melted away, America would still have an appalling racial wealth and income gap.  There would still be defacto segregation not only in housing, but also in health, schools, and other public services. \r\n\r\nThat being stated, a study by Douglas Massey and Jacob Rugh of Princeton revealed the extent to which African-American communities have been hit extra hard by foreclosures and bank evictions. It revealed that banks had targeted black mortgage customers for sub-prime loans and were given worse deals on their loans than white mortgage customers with similar credit scores.  More often than not, communities of color are disproportionately affected by economic externalities that puts profit before life and sacrifice our ecological integrity. Why are certain communities sacrificed while others continue to thrive? This ecological and economic disparity cannot continue if humanity is to have a chance of overcoming the colossal problems of climate change, mass extinction, and resource scarcity.\r\n\r\nWorking class people and people of color deserve safe, healthy, affordable communities. We believe people have a right to environmental justice. This is a right to sustainable and healthy neighborhoods and workplaces, healing, quality health care, and reparations for the legacy of toxic abuses such as brown fields, cancer clusters, and superfund sites.  The right to protection from police, INS/ICE, and vigilante repression, which has historically targeted communities of color, women, people with disabilities and gays and lesbians.  As an organization, SAFE is committed to fighting for the rights of immigrants and supports the demand for full legalization made by El Comite and participated in the May Day immigrants rights march.  We expose and shut-down scam artists and predators that target particular ethnic communities, such as Michael Thompson, a corrupt real estate agent that preyed on Luisa Telefoni's family until confronted with a SAFE direct action campaign.\r\n\r\nOn a weekly basis, SAFE engages in targeted canvassing of families facing displacement in the Seattle area.  We bring families from this ethnically diverse region together in solidarity to confront common problems and build better neighborhoods and communities.   As families from different cultures speaking different languages join, the ability of SAFE to connect with more and more communities grows.",

Community meetings continue and outreach is being led by local residents identifying with SAFE and directly fighting to stay in their homes. More outreach with progressive organizations and unions to spread the word about the hundreds of families in Seattle losing their homes every month and SAFE working to help generate a movement. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur growth will help SAFE build more direct action campaigns to pressure banks to stop evictions, protest illegal foreclosure auctions, and raise awareness of the systemic crisis. Through these struggles, the victories and even the temporary setbacks, SAFE will grow the wider movement against bank evictions and environmental degradation.  In conjunction with the direct action campaign SAFE continues a campaign of targeted outreach to families in foreclosure and will launch large scale media campaigns to inform and inspire communities to stand up to and fight for their homes. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the biggest obstacles to fighting for housing justice we face is that people self evict, they are not informed of their rights, given a chance to negotiate, and most importantly they don't have hope that they can fight and win.  Fear is the most effective tool of predatory bankers, lawyers, and real estate agents.  No one can stand up to the might of these financial institutions and the complicit courts on their own.  The power of solidarity is our greatest weapon.  \", \"The declaration of unity (petition) is signed by representatives of half of the households in South Park calling for an end to bank evictions and reasonable negotiation with residents. The attempt to evict Jeremy Griffin is thwarted by public pressure and opposition. Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank accept Jeremy's lease purchase agreement. SAFE members continue to meet with Sheriff's Department and begin to open up lines of communication, pressuring them to be more transparent about the eviction process on the road to a moratorium.\", \"Fall 2013\", \"SAFE works with WA CAN \\\"Reset Coalition\\\" to pressure City Council to act. NW Trustee foreclosure auctions, that account for roughly two thirds of all foreclosures and evictions, are disrupted by public protest on much larger scale. Outreach is increased with availability of resources to support canvassing stipends, transportation, and phone lines. SAFE will continue monthly mass demand deliveries to banks in down town Seattle. That is to march to various banks and collectively delivering public letters that tell our members' stories and strongly encourage the banks to negotiate. More pickets will be planned in front of banks that refuse to acknowledge people, as well as protests at auctions. These actions will continue to be targeted and representative of individual families in foreclosure. \", \"Union outreach spreads with local unions including Unite Here Local 8, Ironworkers Local 86, Carpenters Union Local 131, the American Federation of Teachers, and the King County Labor Council.  SAFE Finds members of their local in foreclosure and other unions are approached about checking their rank and file with our foreclosure data and bringing them into the movement.\", \"Winter 2013\", \"We continue to promote a culture of resistance where being a target of these predator banks and fighting back against them is not something to be ashamed of and hidden but rather a badge of honor.  We will host increasingly bigger community meetings while building up our network of Pro Bono attorneys and our knowledge and public outreach materials to share with all those who need them.  SAFE will expand it's capacity to stand in solidarity with an increasingly large number of families battling to stay in their homes while organizing them into mass struggles for negotiations, bank tenancy agreements, and principle reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect actions will continue to be organized as case work will become more collectivized as SAFE outreach brings in more families fighting foreclosures with the same banks as other families already active in SAFE. Our weekly meetings should be reaching numbers in which we will have to use the Bethany UCC sanctuary to host. The SAFE office will be much too small for the more than fifty people coming to our weekly general meetings in which we encourage more people to become advocates for themselves and others.\", \"NW Trustee foreclosure auctions are widely publicized in the media and SAFE works with old contacts from OUR WA to pressure the attorney general to insist NW Trustee abide by Washington State laws and end their private auctions. More progressive organizations are brought into the effort to push for a moratorium on foreclosure and bank eviction.\", \"Spring 2014\", \"SAFE will do solidarity action with the national networks of local action groups across the country working to build a movement to achieve moratoriums on foreclosure as the United States did in 25 states during the 1930s. Our movement will continue to push for human dignity bringing forward the plight of the house-less and standing in solidarity with the human right to housing.\", \"SAFE will join the King County Coalition to End Homelessness. SAFE's efforts to fight foreclosure will have at least a score of successes in which we have pressured banks to negotiate tenant agreements with foreclosed families rather than evicting and blighting neighborhoods.  SAFE's work inspires the formation of local action groups in other cities in Washington State.\", \"Summer 2014\", \"SAFE's expanded base, with the support of a broad local network of community organizations and activists, will carry out a massive direct action campaign to end Wall Street's ability to evict people from their homes.  Banks will be picketed, foreclosure auctions will be protested and evictions blockaded and halted on a much larger scale.  Through direct actions, media attention and public outreach, it will be made politically damaging for local representatives not to support the popular demand for direct relief and an end to \\\"no-fault-bank-evictions.\\\"\", \"The King County Council no longer allows the Sheriff's Department to use taxpayer resources to evict families for the banks. Banks and families in foreclosure are seen as having a civil dispute that should be negotiated in good faith. SAFE begins tenant organizing.  Political awareness of housing justice will be strong.  Seattle is moving to a position of having legal protections for bank tenants similar to what has been achieved in Boston by City Life/Vida Urbana.\"]",

PSJ was founded in 1999, and we have developed a pioneering and provocative model that works with all of those most directly affected by crime, violence and the criminal justice system (survivors of crime, people convicted of crime, and the families of both) to advocate for approaches to public safety that are more just and that effectively build safer and healthier communities. This approach offers a holistic perspective on needed system change and a valuable strategy for shifting Oregon towards more effective, prevention-based approaches to addressing crime.\r\n\r\nOur Goals: \r\n\r\n1.\tA reduction in the over-reliance on incarceration as a response to social problems; \r\n2.\tA redirection of public resources away from less effective and more costly approaches to public safety (incarceration) toward public services that can build strong, safe communities (education and human services) and prevent future violence and crime;\r\n3.\tIncreased community services and support for survivors of crime and violence; and\r\n4.\tA reduction or elimination of the ways Oregon treats youth as adults within the criminal justice system.\r\nHere are a couple of major accomplishments: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn 2011, PSJ was central in the passage of HB 2707. The Safe Kids, Safer Communities Act changes the default placement of youth charged as adults being held pre-trial to juvenile facilities in order to keep youth out of adult jails. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tPSJ was heavily involved in passing a landmark omnibus corrections savings law in 2009 (The Safety and Savings Act). The Act included a range of sentencing reforms that saved roughly $50 million in reduced need for prison beds and reinvested those savings into smarter approaches to public safety. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "PROBLEM: Oregon\u2019s criminal justice system is focused on incarceration as the primary strategy to create and maintain public safety. This is the most expensive and the least effective approach to creating public safety and this imbalance has resulted in a wide range of negative consequences for which communities of color and low-income communities have disproportionately suffered the brunt. The state has been on a serious prison build up over the past 15 years \u2013 creating a resource shift of public dollars away from critical services like healthcare, human services, and higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBLEM: The state currently treats juveniles in some instances as adults in the criminal justice system. A wide variety of research suggests that these policies are both an ineffective approach to public safety and also threatens the future success of those youth.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM: A small number of reactionary crime victim advocates have created a powerful and unrepresentative voice in promoting \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d policies; meanwhile, the real interests of crime survivors are somewhat ignored with existing community-based and system-based support services for crime survivors receiving largely inadequate resources to meet the need.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that structural racism underlies and drives criminal justice policies in the U.S. and we are committed to prioritizing work that engages and serves communities of color that are disproportionately affected by both crime and over-incarceration.\r\n\r\nWe believe that in order to build the necessary power to create change, we need to grow the number of effective grassroots advocates who feel both empowered as individuals and who also understand the need to exercise collective power. We are very intentional about building the skills and involvement of our members so they can become more effective social change advocates. There are a variety of ways we do this. We organize Action Teams that meet almost monthly as a space to develop community, increase the issue knowledge and organizing skills of our members, and to gather feedback on strategies and programs. We have Action Teams in Portland, Salem, and Eugene.\r\n\r\nWe also regularly present trainings that range from how to effectively engage your family, friends, and neighbors, how to write a successful letter to the editor, understanding the state budget, to how to build a relationship with your legislator. These trainings are integrated into Action Team meetings, our annual statewide gathering, Lobby Days and stand-alone events. We also look to create special opportunities for members who have the potential to step into more public roles like: speaking with the media, testifying at hearings, and representing PSJ at key convenings, conferences or coalitions.\r\n",

    "narrative4": "Organizing Focus for Next Year: As we are writing this proposal, we are six weeks away from the end of our legislative session. We are working hard to pass a package of sensible sentencing reforms that would flatline prison growth over the next decade and invest some of the savings into more cost-effective and prevention-oriented public safety strategies; strategies that help people re-build their lives like addiction treatment, mental health programs, victim services, and re-entry programs. We also hope to pass a bill that would mitigate the way Oregon\u2019s mandatory minimums automatically treat youth as adults.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it has taken us years of organizing to get to this point. We are not yet sure if we will succeed in the coming weeks. If we do, we will have to vigorously defend the victory because we have opposition that could look to refer the legislation to the ballot or repeal pieces in the 2014 legislative session. Of course, if we don\u2019t succeed, we will need to step back, take stock, and refocus our work.\r\n\r\nSo describing what our work will look like over the next year is very difficult to do. Here are several core strategies that will be unlikely to change.\r\n\r\nSampling of Key strategies:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIncrease strategic concentrations of educated and active grassroots advocates in key locations\r\n\u2022\tIncrease and sustain legislative champions for sentencing reform and justice reinvestment\r\n\u2022\tBuild a powerful and active coalition of groups and individuals to help advocate for justice reinvestment: the Oregon Coalition for Safety and Savings\r\n\u2022\tIncrease media coverage of our issues with supportive frames\r\n\u2022\tDisseminate material that highlights ways in which communities of color are disproportionately impacted by the justice system and promote solutions \r\n\u2022\tMake presentations and disseminate materials among victim advocates and organizations about the benefits of a justice reinvestment framework\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Although PSJ\u2019s core goals are focused on criminal justice reform, we consider ourselves a movement-building organization. It is important to note that we are reaching people not already connected to progressive political work. Our membership has many people for whom their first politicizing moment came with their engagement with the criminal justice system. We make it our job to further people\u2019s politicization by making connections between other issues and communities. As a movement-building organization we must balance the goals of building our organization and advancing our mission and agenda with serving as useful allies in other areas of critical social justice work. We take the ally role very seriously and intentionally seek opportunities to support the struggle for gender justice, immigrant rights, equity for the LGBT community, and other critical movements. \r\n\r\nAlso to advance our own goals, a core strategy of ours is to build coalitions and alliances with other groups and organizations that support our policy goals and can amplify our messages and power. It is very difficult for just one grassroots organization to make very serious statewide change happen on its own. we staff a powerful and effective coalition called the Oregon Coalition for Safety and Savings. The coalition has allowed us to broaden our base and collaborate with some groups much more powerful than us. The coalition includes groups like SEIU, the Oregon Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, the Oregon Student Association, the Human Services Coalition of Oregon, and many others.\r\n\r\nWe are also engaged in a collaborative project to create a racial equity legislative report card.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "We talk earlier in the proposal on how we consider ourselves part of a larger movement. We work in a range of ways with groups working for LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights, economic justice, and other oppressions.\r\n\r\nIn regard to racial justice, we use a race lens to inform our external and internal work and make sure that core elements of our goals are designed to explicitly create racial justice. For example, we are actively working to pass racial impact statement legislation. This bill would create racial impact statements for criminal justice and child welfare bills. This tool would help identify proposed legislation that could increase institutionalized racism.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "The Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance (MIJA) was formed in 2012 as a statewide non-profit organization working for immigrant rights. MIJA's mission is to educate the public about our migrant communities and provide services to empower these communities. Although a new organization, MIJA grew out of immigrant justice work previously led by the Gallatin Valley Human Rights Task Force (GVHRTF) and its community advisory board \"Salud y Comunidad: Latinos en Montana\" made up of Mexican migrant community members and bilingual community organizers.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, the GVHRTF and Salud y Comunidad centered its work on immigrant justice. Using a community-engagement model, we worked to deliver \"Know your Rights\" legal clinics, health clinics, and educational programming in Southwest Montana. To do this work, we partnered with immigration attorneys (including Shahid Haque-Hausrath), community health clinics, Catholic churches, and faculty and students across Montana State University to build awareness and bridges across communities.  However, over time, it became clear we needed a dedicated immigrant rights organization.\r\n\r\nWith funding from SJF, the GVHRTF, Salud y Comunidad, and immigration attorney Shahid Haque-Hausrath formed MIJA. Structurally, MIJA has a Board of Directors (BOD; including former GVHRTF board members, Salud y Comunidad members, and other individuals from around the state who are dedicated to immigrant justice). Those Salud y Comunidad members who do not wish to join the MIJA BOD continue to serve in an advisory capacity and support organizing efforts. This past February, MIJA and Salud y Comunidad attended a weekend retreat led by Bonnie Satchetello-Sawyer of HOPA Mountain to formalize our structure, mission and vision.  \r\n\r\nSince its incorporation, MIJA has continued to provide legal and health clinics, co-organized a statewide rally for Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR), and has led the legal fight against LR-121, a referendum to deny certain state services to \u201cillegal aliens\u201d.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Although Montana has a small immigrant population, this population is under attack and the national anti-immigrant discourse (fueled by corporate greed, a weakened economy, racism, and class warfare) is seeking to marginalize and criminalize immigrants--and especially those coming from the global south to escape the ill-effects of policies like NAFTA. The Montana Legislature continues to develop (and pass) numerous anti-immigrant laws that preclude immigrants from accessing services and legal protections in the workplace. Montanans overwhelmingly passed LR121 which denies undocumented immigrants access to myriad state services (including access to higher education, victim services). And while anti-immigration efforts affect all of us by bolstering a hostile, ill-informed, anti-immigrant community, the most vulnerable include migrants from Mexico in search of a better life. \r\n\r\nResearch conducted locally by MIJA Vice President Bethany Letiecq (Associate Professor, Family and Community Health, MSU) suggests members of the Mexican migrant community have been negatively impacted by this context, suffering from high levels of depression, worry, and fear and other poor physical health outcomes. Many immigrants here live on the social and economic margins, and many choose not to organize against immigrant injustice because of fears of being \"out\" in the community and targeted for deportation. Montana is not a very welcoming or safe place for Mexican migrants, especially those without papers, and our work seeks to address these problems and build collective power using a multi-layered approach.\r\n\r\nFor the past 5 years, GVHRTF and Salud y Comunidad and now MIJA have been working in concert to organize for immigrant justice. It has proven to be a slow going but sustained effort increasingly led by new immigrants. Focusing at the individual-level, we have worked to address the basic needs, health care needs, and legal needs of Mexican migrants. Using social media and word of mouth organizing, we offer Know Your Rights legal and health clinics (with partner health organizations) as well as clinics with the Mexican Consulate. These efforts seek to facilitate resource acquisition and address basic security and safety needs of community members. These efforts also provide for social engagement, build solidarity, counter feelings of isolation, and identify those emerging leaders who choose to courageously step into leadership roles either through Salud y Comunidad or MIJA engagement.\r\n\r\nStatewide, our efforts build collective power by growing a coalition of organizations for immigrant justice.  At this level, we work with our partners to resource-share to push pro-immigration messaging and educate communities and legislators about immigration, discrimination, family separation, and the criminalization of migrants. We lobby collectively against anti-immigrant laws and for CIR. And MIJA has led the fight against LR121. These combined efforts seek to counter anti-immigration efforts and empower Mexican migrant community members to actualize justice.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "narrative4": "Workplan:\r\n\r\n1. Community Clinics: Led by our community organizers, we will offer at least four clinics to provide free legal and health-related services and connection to the Mexican Consulate. At clinics, Salud y Comunidad members will sell traditional Mexican food and provide child care. We house these clinics in safe spaces now well-known to the migrant community.\r\n\r\n2. Education and Outreach: To educate community members and service providers, we will hold educational forums at local churches and libraries (led by MIJA/Salud members) and host at least one service provider training in partnership with local health and public services organization allies.\r\n\r\n3. LR121 Lawsuit: MIJA's Shahid Haque-Hausrath (with attorney Brian Morris) are working pro bono to challenge and enjoin LR121. MIJA has already succeeded in obtaining a partial preliminary injunction stopping portions of the law from going into effect.  See http://www.mija.org/immigration-facts/lawsuit-against-lr-121/ . As this lawsuit continues, we seek funds to pay for certain court expenses, travel and translators for critical witnesses, and to pay for costs associated with depositions.\r\n\r\n4. Organizational Growth: Finally, our workplan seeks to continue to grow MIJA and our local and statewide coalitions. Through mailings, fundraisers, and outreach efforts, we hope to grow MIJA's membership base. Our coalition building efforts are necessary as we need all hands on deck to build a progressive, pro-immigration movement in Montana.\r\n\r\nWe will disseminate our workplan and provide updates to the community documenting what we have achieved (using Facebook and MIJA website). We will assess our work by holding monthly meetings with Salud y Comunidad who will continuously check with their migrant networks seeking feedback on our efforts. This reporting will ensure accountability. We will also periodically assess board membership and recruit immigrant leaders to serve--our numbers will reflect our success at sustaining MIJA and Salud Y Comunidad and community empowerment.", 
    "narrative5": "Two central statewide partnerships with MIJA and Salud y Comunidad are the Montana Human Rights Network (MHRN) and Montana Women Vote (MWV). Both MHRN and MWV have provided technical support, shared membership lists, and provided resources to substantially support the growth and educational outreach efforts of MIJA/Salud. For example, our partners have helped to fund mailings on CIR and LR121 and have conducted phone banks with us to educate voters about LR121. Such collaborations allow us to expand our reach and help us to target different audiences as we work to educate our constituencies about immigrant justice.\r\n\r\nMIJA and Salud y Comunidad bring to our collaborations the largest network of immigrants in the state. We use Facebook and the MIJA website to inform our membership of upcoming events, educate them about immigrant issues, and alert them to legal and policy updates (e.g., CIR, LR121). Our \"closed group\" Salud y Comunidad/MIJA Facebook page currently includes 208 members and the content is delivered mostly in Spanish (or easily translated using FB tools). Because Montana's foreign-born population comprises 2% of the population, migrants are often hidden and hard to reach. Our partners do not have the resources to develop deep networks within the immigrant population. But they have significant expertise and statewide reach. Our collaborations and resource sharing yield significant \u201cbang for the buck\u201d and, importantly, support critical analysis work to ensure we are not working to empower one group while marginalizing or \u201cothering\u201d another group.\r\n \r\nBy collaborating with MHRN and MWV (among many other organizations, such as churches, community health clinics, student organizations), we strategically leverage our resources in a state that is the 4th largest in area with just over 1 million people. Our collaborations unify us as we rely on each other to build a democratic, community-based, participatory progressive movement.   \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Our work clearly focuses on racial justice as anti-immigrant efforts are discriminatory and racist at their roots. Immigrant justice will yield racial justice (and vice versa). Our work draws upon two frameworks--a cultural ecological framework and a racial justice framework. From an ecological perspective, we recognize the connections between individuals, families, communities, and state and federal governments. Efforts to promote immigrant and racial justice must be multi-layered as we seek to empower individuals by working to ensure their basic needs are met while also changing opportunity structures, laws and social policies at all levels of society. And it is a collective effort where those who are most vulnerable are empowered to lead and those most privileged are called upon to use their power and social location to address inequalities, discriminatory practices, and policies that for too long have been used to oppress people of color. \r\n\r\nIn addition, a racial Justice framework is central to the values and work of MIJA (and our coalition partners including MHRN and MWV) and a racial justice lens will be used as strategies, tactics, and decisions are being made throughout our effort.  To constructively work on immigrant justice there must be a racial justice framework.  Many immigrant communities are communities of color and for the last two decades, the overarching public narrative around immigration has been framed around race (mainly by anti-immigrant opponents).  In our efforts, a racial justice framework means ensuring that our collaboration is assessing disproportionate impact and outcomes for immigrant communities of color who are disproportionately poor.  \r\n\r\nOne significant strength of this proposal is our commitment to ensure immigrant leadership on MIJA and Salud y Comunidad boards and to work in partnership with Montana\u2019s immigrant communities on all phases of the work. Through community-based, participatory, and democratic processes, we will work in concert to build on our collective strengths while centering those most affected by anti-immigration efforts. We collectively believe that the most vulnerable among us must be those who lead the discourse on racial justice and guide our efforts to actualize justice.  Thus, we are committed to redistributing power where we can and empowering members of the immigrant community to lead. We are well-situated to carry out this work, given the last six years of organizing within the immigrant communities (especially in the Gallatin Valley) and recent organizational work between MIJA (comprised of 5 immigrant community members of color) and Salud y Comunidad (which is made up of a majority of Mexican migrant community members). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

New immigrants, commonly confronted with financial, food and housing insecurity, also face racial homogeneity, significant language barriers, cultural and political resistance, overt hostility to their presence, and gaps in service provision often due to ill-equipped and ill-informed service providers and educators. Migrants also face racial profiling by local law enforcement and ICE deportation efforts resulting in heightened fear, stress, and anxiety. \r\n\r\nUsing a community-engagement model, it is our goal that the leadership of MIJA and Salud y Comunidad include a majority of community members directly impacted by immigration injustice. This ensures significant immigrant involvement in organizational leadership, and Salud advisers hold MIJA accountable to the larger immigrant community. \r\n",

We continue to read in our local and national media outlets and hear people use the term \"illegal immigrant\" when referring to people who are not currently authorized to be in the US. Immigrants have been systematically dehumanized and criminalized in the US.  \r\n\r\nIn Montana, our Mexican migrant community partners have shared countless stories about  illegal workplace practices, racial profiling, racial and workplace discrimination, resultant economic strife, health care crises, fears of deportation, family separation due to deportation, and overt hostility and bad acts committed against immigrants of color. Because of their social location, many migrants have few opportunities for redress. We have witnessed the erosion of due process and immigrant justice. For example, we have heard stories where Montana's law enforcement agents work in partnership with ICE on the highways to target immigrants of color, make what we would consider to be questionable stops, where local law enforcement officers then ask questions about status, and then turn immigrants over to ICE on the spot if drivers and/or passengers cannot document their status. And most recently, under sequestration we are seeing emergent hits to immigrant justice. Montana's deportation cases are no longer heard in Montana--the proceedings are now televised and heard at a distance in Texas. As immigrants are marginalized in our local, state, and federal systems, they are systematically dehumanized and criminalized. \r\n\r\nOur efforts seek to support and empower Montana's immigrant communities and especially the Mexican migrant communities  here by educating community members about their rights, providing free legal and health services, and providing safe and supportive opportunities to congregate, be social, and share resources.  This work is needed perhaps now more than ever. ",

Staff evaluates these housing problems in terms of whether or not a) the alleged practice is or could be illegal under the Fair Housing Act; b) whether the provider is covered; c) whether the alleged act meets the Act's \"timeliness\" criteria; and d) whether the alleged practice appears in documentable or documented fact to be disparate treatment or have a disparate impact based on a protected characteristic of the complainant.\r\n\r\nSince 1994, the Council recorded some 3,624 fair housing complaints, characterized as follows:\r\n\u2022\tDisability 1100 (47%)\r\n\u2022\tNational Origin 385 (16%) \r\n\u2022\tFamilial Status 488 (21%) \r\n\u2022\tRace, Color, Religion, and Sex 394 (16%)\r\n \r\nMost complaint intakes focus on rental practices. The rest include advertising, real estate sales, lending and zoning issues. IFHC also identified 343 multi-family complexes statewide which appear to violate, in some degree, the design and construction accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act.\r\n\r\nFrom 1995-2012, IFHC has referred over 1,558 complaints to HUD. In addition, the Council has filed 168 design and construction complaints with HUD and about 300 other complaints on its own behalf focused on national origin, familial status, disability, and advertising practices.\r\n \r\nSome outcomes of Council's enforcement work in past 18 years:\r\n\u2022 Over 250 complainants, as victims of discrimination, have received over $250,000 in settlements directly.\r\n\u2022 Over 162 design and construction settlements have provided for retro-fits, modifications or accommodations in all those complexes. Settlements also achieved more than $1,250,000 in retro-fit funds, for retrofitting other rental or owner-occupied units for persons with disabilities.\r\n\u2022 The State Housing Agency (IHFA) modified its HOPWA regulations regarding access to medical files of persons with AIDS and other disabilities because of IFHC advocacy. \r\n",

This in turn will strengthens our network of collaborative partners and allows us greater reach in a geographically far flung state.\r\n\r\nProblems, needs, issues: The IFHC works to ensure fair housing choice for all in the state of Idaho.  This project will serve to affirmatively further fair housing by focusing on building inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination. Our past history of complaint activity illustrates the housing discrimination that occurs in great numbers in the state of Idaho and its disparate impact on low income, refugee/immigrant and LEP individuals and families, the disabled, and single females with children.\r\n\r\nWe define an inclusive community as one in which all people - regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, disability, or sexual orientation - have access to the same housing, transportation, health, education and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nRoot causes: This project will assist community organizers, organizations, and activists by exploring oppression as the primary root cause of housing discrimination issues and a bar to affirmatively furthering fair housing. We define oppression as a violent system in which an inequality is perpetuated through inescapable social positions such as gender, sexual orientation, race, class, ability, and age.\r\n\r\nWe will review root causes with project participants utilizing a \"Housing Privilege Checklist\" that addresses nearly 40 items that impact housing choice and oppression in the following \"root cause\" areas:\r\n\r\n\u2022 RACE\r\n\u2022 ABILITY\r\n\u2022 LITERACY/LANGUAGE\r\n\u2022 SEXUAL ORIENTATION/GENDER\r\n\u2022 CLASS\r\n\u2022 ACCESS\r\n\r\nWe will discuss the forms of oppression Racism, Sexism, Ableism, Ageism, Classism, and CIS-Sexism/Heterosexism; and their impact on housing discrimination issues.\r\n\r\nBuilding collective power: The workshops will also allow us to foster collective power by training participants in perpetuating these discussions within their communities. In addition to discussion noted above participant's will learn about being effective allies and utilizing tools (see description of workshop goal in following section).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will co-locate our FH Ambassadors, where feasible, or train advocates to establish FH resource centers.\r\n\r\nChange the root causes and underlying power dynamics: By training a cadre of advocates; community members; and community and organizational leaders; we will create a powerful network and a groundswell of empowered individuals that are ethnically, culturally, and geographically diverse to address housing discrimination issues in particular and discrimination issues in a larger general context.\r\n ",

These organizers are either activists or providers in their local communities and form our network of partners in furthering fair housing in Idaho.  This project will support our effort to establish Fair Housing Ambassadors throughout the state to cover the broad area that is Idaho (83,000 square miles), co-locating with partners where feasible. \r\n\r\nIn addition to establishing Fair Housing resource centers with our partners the primary focus of this project will be to provide at least six (6) Diversity/Anti-Oppression training workshops throughout the state for community organizers/partners and their communities; targeted at low-income individuals, rural residents, recent immigrants, limited-English-proficient (LEP) persons, persons with disabilities, and single female heads-of-households with children.\r\n \r\nThese four hour workshops will give advocates and organizers a deeper understanding of anti-oppression not just as theory but as a practice of community empowerment. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to deepen our understanding of oppression perpetuated both intentionally and unintentionally in our meeting/learning spaces, and to explore how to maintain safer meeting/learning spaces in our community building efforts. \r\n\r\nAlong with in depth discussions about privilege, being an effective ally, and consent, those who participate will be introduced to a variety of tools to help tackle oppressive language and structures. \r\n\r\nThis workshop best serves folks who are a part of a diverse community organization or group, in which meeting/learning/gathering spaces are intrinsic parts of their day-to-day processes.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is presented in the context of housing issues but the fundamental tools and knowledge gained by participants, organizers and community members, will serve them well in other contexts and situations.

This vast geographically diverse state (over 83,000 square miles) is notoriously conservative and perceived as a stronghold of white American population.  \r\n\r\nYet Idaho's Hispanic population has increased by 73% since 2000 and continues to increase exponentially. It currently comprises nearly 13% of the population. Some counties in Idaho exceed 25% and as much as 35% Hispanic population.  This does not fully capture the undocumented population and the seasonal influx of farmworkers, predominantly Hispanic.  We collaborate with the Community Council of Idaho, Inc. (formerly the Idaho Migrant Council, Inc.) a Latino, low-income, and farmworker, community-based organization. In the past we collaborated on successful campaigns with them and other Latino and farmworker organizations to remove farmworker exemptions to minimum wage and workers compensation laws in Idaho.  The CCI has representation on our Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nIFHC also reviewed the most current refugee population figures in 2011 (from the Office of Refugee Resettlement from 2008) and determined that - in terms of per capita population - Idaho was second only to Florida in the number of refugees, and when Cuban refugees were factored out, we were first in the nation on a per capita basis. The majority of these refugees face significant bias due to ethnic, language and religious attitudes in the community and often endure poverty in their adjustment to American life.  We have partnered with the Department of Justice to combat some de facto housing segregation that occurs in the placement and housing of refugees in Idaho. Several of our contracted employees are leaders or advocates in their refugee communities.  We collaborate with the Idaho Network for New Americans on refugee rights issues.\r\n\r\nDisabled individuals comprise nearly 13% of Idaho's population and face issues of housing accessibility, discrimination in their use of companion animals in housing, and appropriate design and construction of rental facilities. Nearly half of our cases involve disability issues.  We have representation from Disability Rights of Idaho on our Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nThrough this project IFHC will continue to work cooperatively and collaboratively with these organizations and others discussed in Section 5, to advance a progressive agenda that combats all forms of oppression and discrimination in Idaho.

NPARC is an alliance of organizations and individuals committed to undoing institutional racism. \r\nNPARC acts as a forum to: 1) understand and address the intersection of race, racism and other forms of oppression, 2) share information, resources and best practices, and 3) provide training for members. Members find personal and professional support through a place to share story, and an opportunity to find connections across various sectors; ever important when addressing structural oppressions. In the past six months, NPARC hosted monthly events such as: \u201cRacial Micro-Aggressions: What They are and why They Hurt\u201d, a following discussion circle, \u201cWomen as the Face of Islam: Misconceptions and Realities\u201d, \u201cWhat is YOUR Dream of an Equitable America?\u201d healing circle, \u201cCoalitions as Agents of Change\u201d, and \u201cUndoing Racism: The Transformative Power of Women\u201d.  We also provide, in partnership with consultants and trainiers, small but meaningful scholarships to members who have difficulty paying the full fees for other anti-racism trainings and workshops. We aim to overcome the financial constraints that may keep members from the table.  NPARC also sponsors events such as the White Privilege Conference, the Human Service Awards and Candidate Forums.\r\nRecent accomplishments include: The honor of advocating for and naming an annual human service award, \u201cRon Chisom Anti-Racism Award\u201d through SHSC and the successful advocacy for the City of Seattle to fund human service organizations\u2019 anti-racism technical assistance for 2013-14. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "Anti-racism work evolves to meet the insidious nature of contemporary institutional and structural racism. Much can be gleaned from past struggles, from the Native American genocide to immigrant rights, yet the particular brand of racism today thrives in part because we chose as a society to not accept its very existence. NPARC amplifies the conversation and moves beyond typical anti-racism training modes. We advocate for policy and structural changes, while honoring the human need for camaraderie in struggle. \r\nNPARC identifies meaningful ways to shift the conversation to highlight the practice and evolution of knowledge led by those most affected, people of color. The landscape is saturated with training and services geared to support institutions with predominately white staff in recognizing and dismantling institutional racism. Yet, limited work has been conducted to support racial equity professionals of color, either in an official or de facto staff role or outside support role. Staff of color face frequent racist incidents but have limited access to support that specifically focus on these situations. \r\nNPARC will provide the structure for a Consortium of approximately forty racial equity professionals of color. This Consortium is centered on personal healing support, expanding the network, building community capacity, and previewing the succession pipeline for young anti-racist leaders. Recognizing the intimate nature of anti-racism work, NPARC not only offers professional capacity building support, but also one that recognizes the deep human need for authenticity, story, and healing. NPARC also previews the succession pipeline for future anti-racist leaders by welcoming aboard to The Consortium the young, the student, the awakened, the effected. \r\nNPARC hears the same question from our general membership, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d that often emerges after a heightened awareness of systemic and institutional racism. Seattle organizations and individuals have access to anti-racism training and workshops that get them on board through a deeper understanding but then what? NPARC addresses this question by creating an online referral service for all anti-racism resources such as consultants, trainers, caucus groups, and government agencies. \r\nInternally, NPARC practices collective leadership by supporting three Co-Chairs in leadership positions and a general Steering Committee of five. These Co-Chairs traditionally have overlapping one year terms, thereby insuring that a diverse voice is always at the table. Beginning in 2014, NPARC seeks to hire a part time staff and expand the steering committee to 15 members. \r\nNPARC's work provides our community with a personal support system and professional network of organizations and individuals also committed to undoing institutional racism. By the very nature of the racism beast, this work of addressing this key question \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d cannot be answered with one voice. It is racism that tore us apart, to achieve equity, we must move forward together. \r\n",

The goal is to uphold a space dedicated to the unique experiences of people of color who work in the racial equity field. NPARC will begin this experience of the Consortium by hosting a racial healing circle in September 2013 to start us off in a good place. The Consortium will then work collectively on designing creative and innovative racial equity resources for our unique perspective. For example, the Consortium will be tasked with designing intake questions for the new NPARC online referral system. This system, scheduled to launch in early 2014, will be a public, online tool to access any and all racial equity resources. In addition to the referral system, NPARC will also support the Consortium in the design and mode of presentation of The Passage, a 2-3 day event in the spring of 2014. \r\n2014 will also be the year when NPARC galvanizes our community relationships with communities of color, fellow racial equity advocates with the purpose of supporting an Anti-Racism Budget Task Force. The intent of this task force is to streamline our racial equity policy and budget advocacy potential. Already indicating support, we list Seattle Human Services Coalition, Washington State Budget and Policy Center and Solid Ground. \r\nTo accomplish these lofty goals, NPARC looks this year at best practices to address our growing reach and influence in our racial equity community. In 2014, we focus on these external projects, but also on our own internal sustainability and capacity building. Therefore, we anticipate the inaugural creation of a part time staff position and explore the option of a shared office space and other administrative expenditures to reinforce our institutional continuity. \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Currently, NPARC membership includes the following organizations committed to ending institutional racism: Wellspring Family Services, Within Reach, Child Haven, Child Care Resources, YMCA, Center for Ethical Leadership, Associated Recreation Council, Catholic Community Services, Goodwill, Solid Ground, and WA State Bar Association, and Plymouth Housing Group.\r\nNPARC is an active member of the Seattle Human Services Coalition (SHSC) Steering and Budget Task Force Committees. SHSC is a multi-racial, multi-cultural group of human service providers and concerned community members committed to helping Seattle-King County residents meet their basic human needs. SHSC\u2019s work is organized through thirteen member coalitions each representing an area of service within the community such as hunger intervention, domestic violence prevention and response, early education, eliminating institutional racism, community healthcare and homelessness to name only a few.  These groups of diverse individuals collaborate to identify a shared agenda and mobilize communities to act on a vision to help our communities meet their basic human needs. \r\nNPARC is also an active member of the Minority Executive Directors Coalition (MEDC). MEDC influences public policy affecting people of color by working with economic development agencies, government officials, service providers, and school districts. \r\nThe nature of institutional and structural racism requires us in the racial equity field to look at the many intersections of oppressions in our daily lives. As a person of color, oppression follows us through school, work, housing, health, hunger and beyond. To create an alternate racially equitable reality, NPARC looks closely and consistently at the various points of intersectionality. NPARC has actively built collaborations and partnerships between our own member organizations, between coalitions, between governmental entities and coalitions. Of all the work between institutions, the most impactful experiences for our members rest in those personal interactions. Telling story, sharing pain and hope, we build a movement through empathy.", 
    "narrative6": "NPARC in part acts as a forum to \"Understand and address the intersection of race, racism and other forms of oppression.\" Institutional and structrural racism feeds upon the discord between communities of color. By providing a welcoming space to examine these intersections, by inviting those from diverse communities to participate, NPARC addresses this painful arm of racism. Examples of ways NPARC addresses these intersectionalities can be found in the themes of our monthly meetings: \"Women as a Face of Islam: Misconceptions and Realities\", \"Coalitions as Agents of Change\", and \"Undoing Racism: The Transformative Power of Women\". A full description of our past events, all led by people of color, over the last 9 months can be found on our website, www.nparcseattle.org. We too understand and firmly believe that the perspective of the person of color is of utmost importance in directing meaningful conversation.\r\nAlthough NPARC is a POC led coalition, we are pleased to take this opportunity to share our view on white anti-racist allyship. \r\nTo create a racially equitable society, NPARC looks for ways to strengthen our ties not only with the white community, but also between communities of color. In this process, the future role of white people must also be examined. In these modern anti-racism conversations, we often speak of \"white allies\". At NPARC, we look at this dynamic through a slightly different lens. \r\nIn the supportive dynamic between the white community and people of color, Instead of naming the white person as an ally, NPARC recognizes the untapped potential for people of color to serve as allies. The job of examining and re-directing institutions that were created and now deeply seeped in racism, classism and sexism belongs to those who created it. People of color are often tasked with the dismantling of systems we did not create and were specifically structured to exclude. Too often the burden falls upon our shoulders to prove, explain, and teach white people of our experiences of oppression. In reality, it is the duty of our white community to take the helm in undoing systemic oppressions created to exclude people of color. In this scenario, the person of color is the actual ally.\r\nAs people of color in the journey towards racial equity, NPARC sees healing, creativity, practice and growth as our biggest priorities. Our job in this struggle is to find the best ways to remember collective leaderhsip, redefining of value systems, inclusion and invitation of all voices, re-building of community. In our efforts to create racial equity, our white community find a welcome place to serve as white allies.",

    "narrative1": "The Organization for Prostitution Survivors (OPS) is a grassroots, nonprofit organization started by survivors and allies to end the violence of prostitution. Founded in 2012, OPS creates opportunities for adult survivors in Seattle to seek supportive services to heal, and raise awareness to address the root causes of prostitution. OPS operates within three focus areas: Survivor Services, Community Education, and Men\u2019s Accountability, with all aspects centered on the mobilization and leadership of survivors. \r\n\r\nCo-founder and survivor of 15 years of prostitution, Noel Gomez recognized an acute lack of services for adult survivors of prostitution while working at YouthCare\u2019s Bridge program and facilitating the Sex Industry Workers Class for the City of Seattle. Noel collaborated with Peter Qualliotine and other survivors and allies in Seattle to establish OPS.  Co-Founder, Peter Qualliotine, has been working to change the way individuals, institutions and systems view prostitution for over 20 years. As a male ally, Peter works to interrupt the violence and harm of prostitution with Men\u2019s Accountability Programming.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, the following weekly services for women were established: drop-in, survivor-led support groups, and art workshops. Through peer mentoring and empowerment-based advocacy, OPS walks alongside survivors as they identify their needs. OPS create a non-judgmental environment where survivors can engage in critical dialogue about their experiences and begin to heal.\r\n\r\nOPS is an agent of social change; ending the harm of prostitution for future generations of prostituted people requires changing the social and cultural norms that support it and all other types of violence against women.  The Men\u2019s Accountability Program combats deeply entrenched societal norms and demand for prostitution by educating and forming male alliance networks to work collectively with women survivors.

    "narrative3": "Prostitution often involves coercion and violence on multiple levels.  The majority of survivors were sexually assaulted as children, and subsequently suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, hypertension, depression, and more.  Physically, survivors\u2019 bodies have experienced broken bones, chemical dependency, burns, traumatic brain injuries, and more.  Emotionally, chronic trauma and abuse take years from which to recover.  Survivors face constant danger to their lives\u2014the murder rate for a prostitution survivor in the U.S. is 204 for every 100,000, making it the most dangerous job in the country.  \r\n\r\nCulturally appropriate services for survivors of prostitution are a significant unmet need.  Survivors are stigmatized and victimized by societal attitudes and norms which incorrectly believe prostitution is a free choice and a victimless crime, victim-blaming survivors for the harm they have experience \u201cin the life\u201d. This misconception leads survivors to be discriminated against by law enforcement, service providers, and the general public.  \r\n\r\nOPS recognizes prostitution as a social practice and a system of men's violence against women, children, and sometimes other men.  Prostitution is supported by pervasive cultural norms including male identification of dominance and entitlement to purchase sex.  The root cause of the harm of prostitution lies within male supremacy.  Research reveals many men who do not buy sex tolerate men who do buy sex.  Men possess the power and privilege to choose to engage in prostitution, yet the victim-blaming and social stigmatization of prostituted women make exiting the life extremely difficult, a direct result of the ethics and values of male supremacy.\r\n\r\nOPS builds collective power by organizing across systems; conducting community outreach and education workshops; and by providing peer-based support to survivors and community members. OPS also trains community stakeholders and service providers who work with survivors about the harm of prostitution and provide tools to interrupt this form of gender-based violence. These efforts seek to dispel the myths and misconceptions that prevent effective engagement with adult prostitution survivors.\r\n\r\nOPS addresses the root causes of prostitution with a focus on Men\u2019s Accountability. Through Male Allyship Community Workshops, OPS encourages men to be allies to women by rejecting identification with systems of dominance and opposing the objectification of women\u2019s bodies in the commercial sex industry. The 3-day Male Allyship Train-the-Trainer Seminar builds upon the anti-oppression framework of the 3-hour Workshops, providing a highly interactive, experiential education format and in-depth reflection and dialogue about the systems of patriarchy, male sexual identity and dominance that perpetuate violence against women.  \r\n",

    "narrative5": "A primary vision of OPS is to create coordinated community responses to change the social norms around prostitution. A central value of OPS is our accountability to survivors of prostitution so that our roles of advocate and educator bring survivor experience to bear on the changes we are seeking. OPS is building a broad, effective, and unified movement through collaborative endeavors with government, non-profits, and the private sector. The following are examples:\r\n \r\nFirst, OPS creates social change through partnerships with city and county government. The OPS Director of Men's Accountability and Community Education, Peter Qualliotine, has  20 years of experience working  on the social norms that support prostitution. In 1994, Peter founded one of the first Sex Buyer's Intervention programs in the U.S. and he currently co-leads and advises the Sex Buyer Intervention Program for the City of Seattle. Due to our city and county partnerships, OPS Directors have been privileged to also advise city and county attorneys to change policies that harm prostituted persons. Attorneys have a new goal to dramatically decrease the number of charges brought against prostituted persons and increase charges brought against buyers and pimps.\r\n\r\nSecond, OPS partners with non-profit organizations like the Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC) and Goodwill. Through training, OPS builds the capacity of reputable organizations to serve survivors more effectively. \r\n\r\nThird, through collaboration with Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking and the Washington Lodging Association, OPS helped to lead the first training in the state that educated hotel managers about the harms of prostitution. Ninety-four percent of the attending managers who stated they had not provided training in the past, said that they would begin training hotel staff about the harms of prostitution and appropriate staff responses to this crime against women and children. This training changed social norms around prostitution.",

Historical and contemporary attitudes and practices in the United States result in the commercial sexual exploitation of Native American, African American, Asian women and Latinas. The inequality between men who buy sex and women in prostitution is compounded by the eroticism of race and ethnicity. This sexual/racist objectification of women of color is rooted in slavery and colonialism, and is common throughout the commercial sex industry. Women of color are represented in advertisements for sexual services and in pornography as desiring abuse, violation, humiliation, degradation, or as being sexually different from white women. It is common that buyers of commercial sex seek out a particular racial or ethnic \"type\", demonstrating the inseparability of sexual objectification and prostitution from racism.  \r\n\r\nIn recognition that board and staff members need to represent the diversity of OPS participants, 11% (1) of the board and 30% (3) of OPS staff members are people of color, 100% of staff are low-income, LGBTQ, or dis- or differently abled, and 11% of the board are transgender/gender-variant.  The three staff members of color are also prostitution survivors, including Noel Gomez, Co-Founder and Director of OPS.  Our organizational structure and mission includes purposeful accountability and allyship to survivors.  Survivors are recognized as the leaders of OPS. Although the OPS staff and board and primarily white, our leadership and accountability are to survivors, who are primarily women of color.\r\n\r\nOPS is currently drafting by-laws to mandate board composition be representative of the constituents, including diversity in race, ethnicity, gender identities, sexual orientations, and abilities. All types of oppression make one vulnerable to being prostituted. Prostituted people are primarily female; primarily young; disproportionately people of color, LGBTQ, dis- or differently abled, and poor or working class. OPS recognizes the importance to nurture partnerships with a variety of groups and organizations working to end all types of oppression in order to progress toward the world of OPS vision statement: \" a world free from all forms of oppression and exploitation.\"\r\n\r\nOPS holds racial justice and equity as a priority of utmost importance. Because we are currently composed of a board of primarily white allies, we are in the process of recruiting survivors and allies of color to join the board.  Established for less than one year, OPS is also actively working towards creating partnerships with organizations led by people of color. This is a primary strategy in the above project proposal: to recruit male allies from communities of color.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "The Washington State Parent Advocacy Network (WSPAN) is an association of parents who are \u201cveterans\u201d of the child welfare system who collaborate to improve outcomes for families entering that system.   It is comprised of a network of eight local Parent Advocacy Committees and the Washington State Parent Advocacy Committee (WSPAC), a statewide organization that meets quarterly for networking, planning, and training.  The WSPAN mission is to bring the parent voice into the development of child welfare policy and practice; promote improved and equitable outcomes for all children and parents regardless of their race, gender, or circumstance; and advocate for parent leadership in the direct service, training, and public awareness activities that strengthen and support those families.\r\n\r\nThe WSPAN began in April 2007, when Catalyst for Kids and a \u201cveteran parent\u201d leader convened the first WSPAC meeting.   Catalyst for Kids continues to provide for WSPAN development and support.  Significant WSPAN legislative policy work began in 2011 when, as a member of the Strong Family Northwest cohort, the WSPAN benefited from the robust advocacy training and technical assistance provided as well as from a modest grant that enabled the development of an infrastructure to support its advocacy work.\r\n\r\nAccomplishments:\r\n\u2022\tWSPAN  policy priorities for the 2012 and 2013 Washington State Legislative sessions all became law (see www.wspan.org/WSPAN_Policy.html) \r\n\u2022\tVeteran parents are active and sought after members of statewide advisory committees including the Washington State Racial Disproportionality Advisory Committee; the Children, Youth and Family Services Advisory Committee; and the Washington State Commission for Children in Foster Care.\r\n\u2022\tLegislators and other policy makers frequently attend WSPAC meetings to gain the parent perspective on proposed policy and practice.\r\n\u2022\tThe WSPAN received the 2013 Children\u2019s Justice Conference Lee Ann Miller Award as the organization making the greatest contribution in furthering the goals of the Children's Justice Act.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "On January 1, 2013, there were 9,758 Washington State children living in foster care. These data represent a trauma for both the children involved and their parents.   While there is unambiguous agreement that children must be protected from unsafe living environments, it is by no means clear that removing children from their parents is the best avenue for achieving this goal.  The prevailing (although incrementally changing) child welfare paradigm, supported in part by policy, outmoded practice, and categorical funding, is that children should be removed from unsafe families and placed with good and caring substitute families.  This paradigm must be changed, with policy, practice and funding all recognizing that in most situations children are best off with their parents, and that, with necessary services and supports, most parents can safely provide for their children\u2019s safety and well-being.  \r\n\r\nChild welfare involved families are among the most marginalized families in our community.  In the face of the daunting circumstances faced by these families, it is perhaps understandable that the predominant child welfare paradigm has been to remove children from these parents instead of giving parents support to personally provide for their children\u2019s safety and well-being. The challenges can be overwhelming.  The primary federal funding source for child welfare services, Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, provides states with funding only after a child has been removed from his family and is living in a foster home or in a subsidized adoptive family.  Social workers and policy makers who care about children can tend to believe that children\u2019s needs can be better served by a family other than their birth family.   Notwithstanding an essentially progressive child welfare practice model adopted by the Children\u2019s Administration, white, middle class professionals are not immune from bias based on race, economic status, and life style.  The institutionalized racism prevalent in all systems with which families engage creates additional barriers to success for the families of color who find themselves involved with the child welfare system.  Parents who are already marginalized by life circumstances are further marginalized and stigmatized by a system that is often biased against them.\r\n\r\nThe WSPAN changes this system by bringing the parent voice into the development of child welfare policy and practice. WSPAN members use their personal stories of life transformation to educate and inspire policy makers into recognizing the validity of the WSPAN message \u2013 \u201cPeople Change/Families Reunite.\u201d  They get trained in racial equity, policy and advocacy; identify issues underlying the barriers to parents\u2019 success and develop policy priorities to address those barriers; recruit additional parents to work with them; gain legislative champions; collaborate with other coalitions; lobby for legislative change; celebrate success; and begin the process all over again.  \r\n",

    "narrative5": "Catalyst for Kids, itself, is a coalition of child welfare professionals, consumers, advocates, and decision-makers partnering to bring about transformational change of the child welfare system.  Similarly, the Washington State Parent Advocacy Network \u2013 which is staffed and supported by Catalyst for Kids, and whose policy work will be supported by this grant - is a coalition of veteran parents and professional advisors who are partnering to effect social change.\r\n\r\nBoth Catalyst for Kids and the WSPAN participate in other social change coalitions, including: \r\n\r\nKing County Coalition on Disproportionality (www.kccrd.org) \u2013 Purpose is to eliminate racial disproportionality in the child welfare system.  CFK provides staffing to the Coalition and WSPAN members participate.  The King County Coalition has been instrumental in educating Washington State policy makers about disproportionality and in influencing legislation that requires the state to work toward its elimination.\r\n\r\nLow Income Housing Alliance (www.wliha.org) \u2013 Purpose is to ensure that all state residents thrive in safe, healthy, affordable homes.  WSPAN actively collaborates with LIHA in advancing a shared policy agenda.  In both 2012 and 2013, one WSPAN policy priority related to Fair Tenant Screening, bills that were primarily championed by LIHA and actively supported by WSPAN members.  Both in 2011 and 2012, WSPAN members won LIHA legislative advocacy awards.\r\n\r\nThere is significant crossover between the WSPAN and both of these Coalitions.  WSPAN members have been educated about disproportionality and are committed to actions that work toward its elimination.  They strive for a membership that reflects the racial/ethnic diversity of the families served by the child welfare system.  Regarding LIHA \u2013 there is not a WSPAN member who has not been negatively impacted by the lack of safe and accessible housing.  Most WSPAN members have, at one time or another, been clients of both the child welfare and housing systems.  \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Catalyst for Kids (CFK) is deeply engaged with issues related to racial justice.  Catalyst for Kids provides staffing support to the King County Coalition on Disproportionality - professionals and community leaders representing more than 40 organizations in child welfare, the courts and legal systems, public and private agencies, community members and other community stakeholders in King County, Washington serving youth and families who partner to eliminate the racial disproportionality and disparity that exists in our state\u2019s child welfare system.  CFK provides leadership in Coalition training activities, and recently sought funding from the City of Seattle Race Equity Initiative to offer community-wide training on issues related to race equity.  Coalition leadership is also actively promoting collaborative efforts to identify, be trained on, and consistently implement a race equity assessment tool.  \r\n\r\nThe Director of Catalyst for Kids, Nancy Roberts-Brown, represents the Coalition in statewide work to address race equity.  She serves as a member of the Washington State Racial Disproportionality Advisory Committee and, in that capacity, acts as a liaison between the work and strategies of the Coalition and the work and strategies of WSRDAC.  Ms. Roberts-Brown is also a member of a statewide advisory committee established to advise on statewide efforts, informed by the 2012 SHB 2536, to increase the use of Evidence Based Practices in state-funded services to children, youth and families.  As an advisory committee member, she serves as a liaison between the Coalition members and the Evidence Based Practices Institute, promoting the institute\u2019s development of strategies to ensure that the Evidence Based Practices provided to children and families of color are effectively provided by organizations that are culturally aware and who demonstrate a commitment to racial equity and the elimination of disproportionality.  \r\n\r\nThe WSPAN also has a demonstrated interest in racial equity.  Members have been trained to understand the racial disproportionality in the child welfare system, and in their statewide recruitment they strive for a membership that reflects gender, race/ethnicity, and region of the families in the child welfare system.  This spring and fall, as a new race equity training, a Roll of the Dice (www.rollofadice.org) is presented throughout the state, WSPAN members are attending at no cost to them.  WSPAN members are also active on the Washington State Racial Disproportionality Advisory Committee (WSRDAC).  Shrounda Selivanoff, an African American veteran parent who serves as the lead of the Washington State Parent Advocacy Committee, was recently appointed to WSRDAC membership and Roxanne Chinook, an American Indian veteran parent and WSPAC member, was appointed to serve as her alternate.  The more that WSPAN members have the opportunity to learn about race equity and issues related to child welfare, the more committed they become to addressing these issues in their work.\r\n",

Every year we march in the Portland Pride Parade and host a booth at the Pride Festival, two efforts that give our organization strong visibility in Portland\u2019s LGBTQ community at large.  \r\n\r\nWe also network with other LGBTQ People of Color (POC) groups such as Portland Latino Gay Pride, Portland Black Pride, and Basic Rights Oregon\u2019s \u201cOur Families\u201d cohort.

Participation in these events also provide visibility to communities where the LGBTQ API demographic is often underrepresented.  We have held gatherings to mark National API HIV/AIDS Awareness Day to educate and reduce stigma associated with HIV/AIDS in our communities.

    "narrative3": "Mainstream LGBTQ movements and communities are dominated by white people and has historically and continues to not always be welcoming to our constituency.  APIs are often perceived as a monolithic identity, when in reality we come from diverse cultures and experiences with respect to sexuality, gender, ethnic and racial identity, among others.  Furthermore, API cultures often view LGBTQ identity as aberrant.  Multiple Asian languages do not have words for \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian\u201d, and cultural pressures to conform to gender roles, marry, and produce heirs is strong. In the article \u201cFamily and Coming Out Issues for Asian Pacific Americans\u201d, HRC states, \u201cFor many Asian Pacific Americans, coming out to family is an enormous challenge. Many fear rejection, disappointing their parents or being seen as sullying the family name\u201d (https://www.hrc.org/issues/3581.htm).\r\n\r\nAs the only LGBTQ API-focused organization in Oregon, we fill an strong need within our communities. We promote the visibility and the just treatment of LGBTQ APIs, providing positive visible presence in the community at large, and creating safe spaces for LGBTQ APIs to openly be their whole selves, to meet other people with shared identities and experiences, and to ultimately break isolation and combat racism, homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism.\r\n\r\nAs the Pacific NW region is predominantly heterosexual, non transgender and white, LGBTQ API\u2019s, often experience social isolation and discrimination.  For LGBTQ API youth, the consequences of this can be uniquely challenging.  In response, APIP hopes to initiate a youth outreach program.  First, we\u2019d like to target outreach to local student gay-straight alliances, especially in communities with higher API populations.  We hope to establish a mentorship program, whereby students mentees are paired with an APIP mentor to provide positive role models and access to a support network.  The nature of the mentorship might span from providing professional advice to supporting a mentee\u2019s issues related to navigating sexuality or gender identity within their cultural sphere.  \r\n\r\nAPIP has published two Zines highlighting LGBTQ API and POC experiences expressed through art, poetry, and writing.  Both Zines were accepted into circulation by the Multnomah County Library, making them accessible to LGBTQ APIs and the broader community throughout the county.  Community driven projects like these are possible through resources like foundation grants and donations.  \r\n\r\nCollectively, APIP\u2019s work addresses racism, homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism by providing culturally relevant safe spaces for LGBTQ APIs to celebrate our whole selves. Our events empower LGBTQ API\u2019s because they aren\u2019t required to selectively express their identities.  We also ensure many of our events are welcoming to families, friends and allies of LGBTQ API\u2019s, including children and elders, which fosters a visible, healthy LGBTQ API community.\r\n",

Through this project APIP reaches a wider demographic by leveraging BRO\u2019s resources and the QTPOC constituencies.  Through the event, APIP strengthens relationships with Oregon\u2019s largest LGBT policy organization, which helps ensure our voice and issues are represented.   Further, APIP and other QTPOC groups can network and support each other for future collaborations.  APIP also builds shared experiences and histories with other QTPOC groups about issues crossing racial boundaries like HIV/AIDS, immigration, access to healthcare and education, and social isolation.\r\n\r\nAPIP is a part of the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (NQAPIA), a national coalition of LGBTQ API groups. NQAPIA holds annual conferences and training forums, which APIP members attend each year to continuously build our leadership capacity. These opportunities also provide an opportunity to learn about national issues such as comprehensive immigration reform, healthcare reform, and bullying, and to bring fresh ideas and energy back to our organization.  A significant portion of our grant need relates to technical assistance to fund expenses for attending these training and networking forums.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, APIP is excited to have been named as a host organization for NQAPIA\u2019s Pacific Northwest Regional Summit.  APIP will collaborate with NQAPIA to organize this 2-day event in Portland providing networking, leadership, and training opportunities for APIP and other LGBTQ API groups in the Pacific Northwest region such as Trikone-NW, and Project Q at API Chaya (formerly PANDACORN).  This regional summit will also enhance visibility for LGBTQ API\u2019s, and provide APIP with a further opportunity to share learnings and experiences common to API LGBTQ communities in the Pacific Northwest.   \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "APIP works towards racial justice primarily by providing culturally relevant safe spaces for our members to network and meet others with shared experiences, and more fully express our whole selves.  Thus, we empower LGBTQ API individuals who may otherwise struggle to break free from social isolation and discrimination in our predominantly white heterosexual society.  \r\n\r\nMany people within the LGBTQ API communities are expected to leave parts of their experiences and selves at the door when in LGBTQ spaces, API spaces and even within their families due to homophobia, transphobia and racism. In LGBTQ spaces, the focus is on LGBTQ on mainstream issues and there often isn\u2019t room for LGBTQ API issues. In API spaces the same is true for LGBTQ issues. APIP counters this by creating spaces for both the cultural/racial and sexual/gender identities of our constituency, and by providing visibility and facilitating connections to outside communities in order to end isolation.  As previously discussed, most of APIP\u2019s events are focused as family-friendly and all-ages events in order to facilitate building a broader ally and support network for our members, and also to foster awareness and education in the broader LGBTQ API community, in particular, with youth.  Being part of a social group can feel like a luxury if you don\u2019t have access to disposable income. Recognizing this, all of APIP\u2019s events and gathering are offered on a sliding fee-scale, and we do not turn away anyone for lack of funds.   \r\n\r\nAPIP also combats the \u201cmodel-minority\u201d myth and strives to promote visibility of the diverse cultures and experiences that make up our constituency.  As an example, it is commonly purported that HIV is not an issue for the LGBTQ API community.  However, recently, the spread of HIV infections has been found highest for API persons as compared to other racial groups, and in 2008, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders had the third largest incidence of HIV infection. Because HIV/AIDS stigma is prevalent in API cultures and because API\u2019s are perceived as having low risk for HIV, testing rates among API\u2019s are extremely low.  In response, APIP has marked National HIV/AIDS Awareness Day to educate and spread awareness, and has long term plans to work together with local API community groups to spread awareness and combat HIV/AIDS stigma so that APIs need not fear social isolation and shame from their families and communities should they seek testing.  Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders have higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity than other underrepresented populations.  APIP promotes health and wellness to combat such health disparities by sponsoring teams in CAP AIDS walk, Heart Walk, and the Doggie Dash. ",

This means preserving traditional cultures, learning and restoring fluency in Native languages, and defending a deep relationship with their lands. \r\n\r\nBy empowering NYLA fellows to be young change makers in Native communities, they are able to preserve traditional culture and language, but also to share and integrate this unique cultural knowledge into broader society. Through economic and educational partnership, NYLA fellows will serve as models for their generation of Native youth: Preserving tradition, while also becoming leaders and innovators in their own communities and broader society. \r\n\r\nNYLA\u2019s young leaders are committed to reversing the severe statistics Native communities struggle with on a daily basis.  While Native communities face many severe poverty indicators, NYLA focuses on the assets and strengths of Native communities: Cultural values, meaningful traditions, and strong intergenerational relationships.\r\n\r\nSelected statistics on Native American communities: \r\n\r\n>At Tribal Colleges and Universities, entering students have family incomes that average $13,998, or 27 percent below the poverty threshold.  Factors such as geographic isolation, limited opportunities in rural areas and on reservations, and low labor force participation rates contribute to a continuous poverty cycle.  \r\n\r\n>As exemplified on the Oglala Lakota Nation, it is estimated that by 2020 over half the population will be under the age of 18. Despite these inevitable shifts, many Tribal Nations do not have the resources or capacity to engage the full potential of their youth population. As such, many Native youth lack the necessary skills to advance their education, employment and other opportunities in a long-term way. \r\n \r\nWithin this difficult context and lack of resources for Native young people, NYLA uses a culturally based curriculum developed directly from fellows\u2019 experiences.  NYLA\u2019s leadership model is strength-based and focuses on the resiliency of each person and culture, and their ability to create social change in their communities.\r\n\r\nNYLA is strengthening collective power by beginning with individuals, by building their capacity and skills to develop collaborative leadership networks with their peers and elders. Many young leaders are often isolated in choosing sobriety, staying rooted in traditional values and organizing for community change. Many NYLA communities are suffering from brain drain, where many talented leaders have moved off the reservation to pursue economic and other opportunities. NYLA seeks to support young leaders who are ready for intensive growth and are committed to staying in their communities for the long-term. The NYLA Leadership and Campaign Action plans are spefically for capacity building for the NYLA members and their communities to achieve and sustain long-term change. ",

    "narrative4": "NYLA\u2019s first two years of operation were invested launching the fellowship program, and building a solid base of participants, mentors, and stakeholders. With this foundation in place, NYLA is poised to spend the next 2-3 years on three major areas of growth:\r\n\r\n1)\tProviding the next stage of advanced leadership development support for existing fellows, including connections to avenues of employment and economic opportunity;\r\n\r\n2)\tExpanding fellow network in South Dakota, Montana, and Washington-state; and\r\n3)\tStrengthening organizational infrastructure and developing a long-term sustainability plan.\r\n \r\nEach year, NYLA recruits at least 10 Native young adults to enter the 24-month fellowship program. In two years of operation, NYLA has built a solid base of 36 fellows, 15 mentors, and numerous stakeholders in philanthropy, the broader progressive movement, gaming tribes, and Tribal Colleges.\r\n\r\nShort-term impact includes:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCohorts of at least 10 Native young people in each 24-month fellowship cycle are trained in core leadership skills and supported to complete individual and community development action plans. NYLA creates a network for each fellow that serves as a critical component of culturally based, collective leadership.  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tStrong and collaborative partnerships with Tribal Colleges in each participating state (SD, MT, WA) have created a self-sustaining mechanism for NYLA\u2019s outreach and recruitment.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tLasting mentorship relationships are fostered between NYLA fellows and Native elders, leading to intergenerational dialogue and the passing down of traditions. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tCollaborative and strategic partnerships are brokered with organizations and stakeholders in the progressive movement to better connect Native organizing and Native young people to the broader movements for social change in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Collaborations: NYLA\u2019s Growing Web of Relationships\r\nThree key collaborations are with the Movement Strategy Center (MSC), based in Oakland, CA; the nationwide coalition, the Generational Alliance; and the regional Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Movement Strategy Center brings a cohesive plan to strengthen emerging efforts that build the progressive social justice movement by supporting individuals, organizations, alliances and sectors to be more strategic, collaborative and sustainable. \r\nIn 2012, NYLA became a member of the Generational Alliance (GA). The GA is a collaboration of 20 national youth organizations building collective power for underrepresented & low-income communities. GA members work together to win real victories on policy priorities based on the Youth Agenda for our communities! To date, NYLA has developed collaborative actions with GA members on voter engagement, labor rights and immigration reform. See GA website for more information: www.generationalalliance.org.\r\n\r\nNYLA's growing partnership with the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians is through the Education Committee and the Youth Committee. NYLA fellows Johnny Buck and Katie Swan are co-chairs of the ATNI Youth Committee and will lead a new NYLA training initiative for ATNI youth (ages 12-18) in Spokane, WA in September 2013.\r\nATNI Goals: http://www.atnitribes.org\r\nProvide forums for information exchange of matters of mutual concerns among member Tribes and constituencies.\r\nProvide processes for the development of consensus on policy on issues.\r\nProvide recommendations for legislation and government policy on behalf of ATNI and member Tribes.\r\nMonitor, collect information, analyze data, disseminate findings and develop policy positions on matters of interest to ATNI and its member Tribes.\r\nProvide technical assistance, education, and training to ATNI and its member Tribes.\r\nEstablish and maintain mutual assistance networks foster strategic alliances between ATNI, member Tribes, beneficial organizations.\r\nProvide effective public relations, education program to non-Indian communities on behalf of ATNI and member Tribes.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Indigenous communities experience compounded forms of oppression, internally from lasting effects of colonialism and the forced assimilation process, and from broader society due to systemic barriers and active forces to undermine and challenge sovereignty rights. NYLA intentionally chooses a holistic approach to community change, where our members focus on the many facets of undoing oppressive structures and strengthening their community capacity for sustained development.  \r\n\r\nNYLA by its very creation embodies the values of self-determination for indigenous communities. Founding members chose to create their own space where the needs of their communities could be addressed through culturally-relevant, grassroots-driven development strategies. Although all NYLA members are Native, there is a great diversity among Tribal cultures. NYLA is beginning first to strengthen relationships across isolated Tribal communities through the passion and vision of young leaders. These young leaders are supported to vision beyond short-term survival needs to help lead their communities forward.\r\n\r\nNYLA also grew from relationships formed in a mainstream progressive youth organization, and at our heart is cross-cultural movement building approach.  NYLA Co-Director Sophia Kizilbash and Board Member and Managing Director of the Movement Strategy Center Rachel Burrows are both non-Native partners in leadership roles within the organization.  Cross-cultural partnerships are listed above with the Movement Strategy Center and the Generational Alliance.  NYLA is also seeking to strengthen our cross-cultural relationship in the Northwest, which is in it early stages between fellows from the Yakama Nation in the Yakima Valley.  \r\n\r\nNYLA's intergenerational approach also plays a key component in generational leadership and social change. This approach is shared well on our NYLA website through a reflection by NYLA Co-Director Kevin Killer (Oglala Lakota/Kiowa) with NYLA Elder Advisory Council member Dr. Teresa Makuakane-Drechsel:\r\n\r\nOUR GREATEST SOLUTIONS ARE ALREADY WITHIN OUR CULTURES\r\nI value my time with Aunty Teresa because of her amazing perspective on using indigenous models of learning to influence systemic change in education. Community organizing is a big piece of this equation as well as having community respect. The challenge is how do we leverage this respect into meaningful change for our families and communities. We also discussed the shared challenges between Native communities in Hawai\u2019i and reservations on mainland such as unemployment, substance abuse, health care and other factors.\r\n\r\nAunty Teresa made excellent point of Native communities solving problems with our own ideas and cultural resources to change outcome rather than one size fits all Alaskan Native/Native American/Native Hawaiian approach to community development. When we fall into this trap and doesn\u2019t yield any results, usually communities accepting resources are blamed as cause for lack of \u2018successful development\u2019. However, by using our own resources and our own systems of understanding, many of the problems can begin to have sustainable solutions.",

Chronic diseases are increasing in our families because of the lack of preventive health care. We need to organize and prepare our  community members for public health careers while advocating for Universal Health Care as a means to assure that everyone will have access health care. \r\nb) Health care providers need to better understand the differences among our cultures and languages besides to assure that competent translators support patients and their treatments. \r\nc) Immigrants communities are facing deportations that are also breaking families and terrorizing people. The proposal under discussion in the congress (S744) to fix the current broken immigration system will not solve the problem of 11 million immigrants: the vast majority will still face hardship towards the Path to Citizenship resulting in continue economic injustice whether because of lack of jobs, or lowest wages paid to them.\r\nd) Latinas are at the bottom of the pyramid workforce, with low levels of professionalization, and paid the lowest wages. \r\nAltogether and the high rates of English Illiteracy especially among Latinos enhance the disproportional distribution of resources and power, leading to social oppression, causing stress, health issues, inequalities, and social injustice.\r\n\r\nWe build collective power by: \r\na) using radical (meaning roots) approaches, such as Popular Education, to practice and develop  leadership, share knowledge and advocacy of community members to dismantle and eliminate the root causes of oppression; b) a portion of our budget support active members who receive incentives to compensate for food and transportation; c) bringing two of the most oppressed groups to face and work together on issues, such as brown-black politics, discuss the root causes of this mis-perception about each other, and the underlying reasons, such as a \"global gentrification\" that are forcing Latinos to emigrate to this country; d) all efforts towards youth participation as well as woman, including Moms, through child care and participate at all leadership activities; e) building awareness and engaging Allies groups who want to learn and integrate with our communities and support social transformation and to end anti-immigrant backlash.\r\n\r\nChanging the Root causes and power dynamics:\r\nCollective MUJER will build strong cohorts of Latinas to develop professionally in public health as Doulas and/or Traditional Health Workers to strengthen and enable them to: a) promote traditional childbirth and breastfeeding among their own communities; b) act as Community Health Leaders focused to reduce health disparities trough training and advocacy; c) be prepared to face a highly competitive market; d) pursue higher education in medical and public health careers; and e) work in partnership with African and Native Americans Doulas.\r\n",

The TREE is developing  partners members capacity (ICTC, Dulas Caribe) to work together, such as African American, Native Americans and Latinas Doulas, through interactive forms to engage and develop public awareness, creation and implementation of community forums.\r\n\r\nCHARLA, Collective Health Advocacy & Rights of Latinas/os, Africans & Allies, a collective of Latinas/os and African/African Americans of small grassroots organizations/groups to engage and develop leadership and advocacy for policy change. Our principle is that Equity and Social Justice can be achieved when community members have the power and are enable to advocate on their own behalf. In 2012 CHARLA included organizations of Allies (Portland Jobs with Justice, Occupy Portland) to create community events where All races and ethnicity are invited to interact and face biases that prevent us to achieve equity. The TREE Institute is the coordinator, organizer, seeker of funds, and offer expertise on use and practice of Popular Education.\r\n\r\nHealth Care for All-Oregon (HCAO) is a statewide coalition with 78 members organizations founded in January 2012 to work for Universal Health Care (Single Payer). HCAO is our strategy to overcome divide and rule opponents against health care for everyone, based on 6 principles - equity, universality, transparency, participation, accountability, public good - and on Vermont state's strategy of Health Care as Human Right to build a large grassroots movement, including immigrants. The TREE is a founder-member and is one of the two Latino immigrants members organizations committed to build this movement, with a seat in the working HCAO Board of Directors. \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Our understanding of economic injustice is that it is an easy form of control over vulnerable people - who cannot access and provide for their human needs - is among the largest forms of oppression, though not easily recognized, specially by whom practice it. Economic injustice it is in fact, a form of keeping women (and men) of lower classes or less formally educated (Oregonian Latinas and Africans) under control to serve one's needs while enhancing ones' wealthy, status quo, and power.\r\n\r\nAs Latinas and Latinos, we are also aware of power control through uses of human workforce, as well as how economic injustice is a combination of racism and homophobia, because people might be afraid to lose their status quo to New Immigrants who might take away their wealthy lives, jobs positions, etc. The recent discourse of conservatives about immigrants' rights to drive were concerns about \"their\" safe roads, but, in fact, they want to keep control over immigrants. \r\n\r\nThe technical support of Oregon Health Action Campaign and Health Reform Allies in 2009, was instrumental for us to starting to engage Allies, to learn from us too. Since then, our community events are designed to bring all ethnicity or identified races and groups to work together. Also, the 2010-2011 CHARLA cohort 35 Latinas/os and Africans worked collectively to change the image and politics of Brown-Black. \r\nMaterials and translation in Spanish are provided to assure that everyone can understand the subjects and participate at collective decisions, as well as food and child care, so that Moms can fully participate. Besides, we work for and encourage collective fundraising so that other communities can participate in our programs. \r\n\r\nThe TREE programs uses pedagogies, such as Popular Education and Theatre of the Oppressed, where the oppressed become actors of their own lives. Immigrants are at the center of debates and actions. Despite of controversial and adverse reactions by the public and even our partners, these social theories and techniques open space to everyone's participate, especially to whom have been marginalized. They act to transform the social oppression. \r\n\r\nWe encourage our members to seek for leadership positions and face the challenges to work with Allies. Leadership development is connected with actions, no matter of participants' formal education (e.g., a Spanish illiterate seasonal farm worker, at the final evaluation, after 10 months of CHARLA work, said: \u201cnow, I feel comfortable to eat with you all\". She had participated at legislators' dialogue!).

In its unanimous \u201cyes\u201d vote, the Portland City Council specifically recognized our efforts in spearheading the campaign for paid sick days. This victory marks big milestone in the history of our organization, not only for what the ordinance will mean to the lives of some 270,000 Portland workers and their families, but also for what it says about the efficacy of the organization we have built.\r\n\r\nFamily Forward Oregon, and it's sister 501c3 organization Family Forward Education Fund, grew out of a grassroots effort led by mothers to enact paid family leave legislation in Oregon in 2009. Out of that early experience, which ultimately fell short, we realized that Oregon needed an organization devoted to ending maternal poverty and improving economic security for all families.  So we set about creating it.\r\n\r\nIn a short amount of time, we have grown into a leading voice for Oregon families. In addition to our successful paid sick days campaign in Portland, we have:\r\n\u2022 Developed a strong organizational infrastructure and base of support.\r\n* Developed a strong online, social media and messaging presence.\r\n\u2022 Led successful, multiracial, issue coalitions that includes unlikely allies -- unions, employers, health and public health organizations, racial justice organizations and more. \r\n* Implemented a legislative agenda in 2013 that  includes pay equity, paid sick days, retirement security, and labor protections for domestic workers. \r\n* Established a program with national partners to recognize and encourage flexible work practices among employers across the state.\r\n* Developed relationships with national partners and funders who support our work and that of organizations like ours in other states across the nation.\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Motherhood is the single greatest predictor of poverty in old age in the United States.  Women still face significant wage gaps due to their gender, race, marriage status, and motherhood.  Overall, women earn 78 cents to the man\u2019s dollar.  African-American women earn 64 cents and Latina women earn 55 cents to the white man\u2019s dollar.  Mothers overall earn 60 cents to the father\u2019s dollar \u2013because women\u2019s wages go down when they have children but men\u2019s often go up.  Single mothers earn less than married mothers. In Multnomah County, a shocking 84% of single mothers of color with children under 5 are living in poverty.\r\n\r\nFamily Forward was founded on the belief that a lack of support for the work of caregiving is a key \u2013 though generally overlooked \u2013 underlying cause of maternal and family poverty. For the work that mothers (and many fathers) do in the home, they receive no pay, no social security, no health care.  In the workplace, mothers are more likely to work in part-time jobs that pay 20% less than the equivalent full-time jobs and that do not offer benefits. Extremely expensive and often unreliable child care can make it impossible to keep working.  Over half of Oregon private-sector workers have no paid sick time, leading to lost pay and job insecurity when workers or their dependent family members get sick.  \r\n\r\nWe advocate for better public policy on issues that affect workers\u2019 ability to care for their families and provide for their families.  Part of our work is to engage and build the voice of mothers and other caregivers who are left out of our current economic system. Our community outreach raises awareness about the current connection between caregiving and economic insecurity as well as the possibilities for change. We work one-on-one with people, helping them prepare to testify at a hearing or advocate for better policies at their own workplace. Most of them have never spoken to political leaders before, or been involved in this kind of collective action. Most of them have significant caregiving responsibilities in addition to paid jobs. We break down the process for them so that they can experience success.  We welcome their kids to join us. We bring them into a community so they know that their small efforts are part of a larger effort and that collectively, we can make a difference.\r\n\r\nAnd we are making a difference.  We are achieving legislative victories on issues like paid sick days, retirement security, and equal pay.  We are working directly with forward-thinking employers to create better, more family-friendly, workplace practices. We are building a movement that will continue to insist that we restructure work with caregiving in mind. \r\n\r\n",

    "narrative5": "Family Forward is part of a national and local movement working to address issues of economic security and caregiving.  A key element of this relatively new movement is that it brings together unlikely allies \u2013 women\u2019s groups, mother\u2019s groups, racial justice groups, anti-poverty groups, public health groups, seniors\u2019 groups, labor unions, and even business owners \u2013 around a core agenda that includes work/family issues like paid sick leave, paid family leave, affordable child care, and equal pay for equal work. \r\n\r\nFrom 2008 to 2010, we participated in and then led a state-wide coalition working to pass paid family leave.  When we joined this coalition, we were the first grassroots group participating.  We were seen as outsiders and worked to establish credibility as an organization that could organize advocates as well as mobilize a grassroots constituency.  We came close to passing paid family leave in 2009 but have not yet succeeded. \r\n\r\nMore recently, we served as the lead organization for a paid sick days coalition that worked for two years to pass a strong paid sick days law in Portland.  We built a strong, multi-racial coalition that includes racial justice organizations, labor groups, public health groups, businesses and more.  Our achievement of a paid sick days ordinance in Portland earlier this year was due to the breadth of our coalition and its ability to sustain its collaborative effort over a long period of time. As the leaders of this coalition, we strived for a collaborative spirit and leveraged the strengths of every organization at the table.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "As we mentioned above, motherhood is the single greatest predictor of poverty in old age in the United States and women still face significant wage gaps due to their gender, race, marriage status, and motherhood.  \r\n\r\nThe few policies we currently have to protect mothers have so far protected mostly well-off women and done little for lower income women or women of color.  These groups are disproportionately represented in low-wage jobs, part-time positions with inequitable pay, jobs with irregular shifts and mandatory, unscheduled overtime, and jobs not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Meanwhile, women of color are actually providing even more family care than their white counterparts.  They are more likely to be single mothers and more likely to be supporting and caring for extended family members.   \r\n\r\nWe work toward racial justice by incorporating race into our analysis of the economic insecurity among mothers.  We organize around issues that are important to all women, but that affect women of color and low-wage women more than they affect white, high-earning women.  For example, for the past two years we led a multiracial coalition to pass a paid sick days ordinance in Portland - and we are now working to pass similar legislation at the state level.  In the Portland metro area, 39% of white workers, 57% of Latino workers, and 42% of black workers in the private-sector do not have a single paid sick day. Low-wage workers, regardless of race, are also much less likely than higher- wage workers to have access to paid sick days. Nationally, a shocking 80% of our lowest wage earners have no paid sick days. \r\n\r\nIn our role as leader of the local coalition for paid sick days, we raised and re-granted funds to racial justice organizations that played an active role in the campaign (specifically, Asian Pasic American Network of Oregon, Center for Intercultural Organizing, and Causa). These organizations were involved in the paid sick days campaign from the beginning. As an ally to communities of color, we have endorsed their health equity and immigration agendas.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we acknowledge that our organization is predominantly white-led and our constituents are mostly white.   We have work to do to become more multiracial internally and to build stronger working relationships with racial justice organizations.  We see this as an integral part of building a strong movement for social justice generally in our state, and our current strategic plan includes goals around increasing racial as well as economic and geographic diversity within our organization and among our constituents.\r\n",

The past 5 years have shown what is possible on the \u201clow road\u201d: unprecedented deportation levels, rampant racial profiling, and an intensifying climate of fear, isolation, and suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe scapegoating of immigrants for our country\u2019s economic woes stem from a contradictory push-pull relationship: our country is reliant upon flexible immigrant labor, yet criminalizes and marginalizes those who come to supply it.  Immigrants are scapegoated for our economic pain, distracting from the reality that our economy continues to be restructured to benefit the rich. In 5 years of economic recession, the wealth gap has only grown.\r\n\r\nRural communities feel a disproportionate amount of this economic pain, with high levels of unemployment, foreclosure, and debt load, at the same time that they see unprecedented changes in their racial makeup, shifting demographics slowly towards the majority \u201cminority\u201d country that we\u2019re anticipated to become within 30 years. Conversations on the economy center on where to cut services and programs, on \u201cimmigrants taking our jobs,\u201d on \u201cwelfare freeloaders\u201d envisioned as people of color and large immigrant families crossing the border to take advantage of social services (which in reality are unavailable to them).\r\n\r\nThe \u201chigh road\u201d that we have been pushing to open would welcome immigrants to our communities, recognizing them for their talents, strong values, and for their inherent dignity as human beings.  It would combat the beliefs and practices that cause immigrants \u2013 especially brown and black immigrants \u2013 to be subject to record levels of deportations, to experience more police scrutiny and investigation, and to have less access to basic needs like health care, higher education, safety and dignified work.\r\n\r\nROP is working to build capacity and skills of HDGs and rural leaders to confront these rapid changes and the injustices rural Latinos face today through our work to build Safe and Welcoming Communities.  Now in our 3rd year of the campaign, we see the impact of our work in the thousands of people reached, the skills and analysis our members are developing, and the new leaders that are joining the ROP ranks.\r\n\r\nThe 2012 election and the resulting spotlight on immigration reform have also showed that \u201cthe giant has awoken,\u201d turning attention towards growing Latino political power.  We see the ripples of this in rural Oregon communities, where Latino leadership is beginning to emerge in new and exciting ways.  ROP is well positioned to support this grassroots bubbling up of energy to not only build long-lasting infrastructure and leadership among rural Oregon\u2019s Latinos, but also to build partnerships at the local level that can challenge the many facets of racism and criminalization of people of color.\r\n",

With the help of a year-long law intern that will start her work with us in September, we will educate communities about opportunities to push back against the massive deportations happening in rural Oregon (including expanding the recent Mulnomah County policy change around ICE holds), and document the practices of law enforcement through surveys, research, and FOI requests.\r\n\r\nLatino Leadership Development\r\nAfter 3 years of organizing with rural Latinos, we are ready to go deeper.  We will create a 16-month Latino organizing plan to build power in local communities, keeping in mind the eminent possibility of immigration reform during this period. Local Latino leadership is key to identifying how criminalization of immigrants is playing out, and in confronting issues like racial profiling, police/ICE collaboration, and unjust detainers policies.\r\n \r\nEducation for Culture Shift\r\nWe will continue to support groups in 8 counties (Columbia, Yamhill, Umatilla, Lincoln, Hood River, Deschutes, Jefferson, and Benton) that have been part of our safe and welcoming work in the past 2 years.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will leverage our successful leadership development to bring the safe and welcoming approach to an additional 10 communities.  Our speakers bureau will draw on grassroots leaders to bring an analysis where immigrants\u2019 safety and inclusion, not criminalization and deportation, is integral to the health of our communities, and help communities take steps for identifying and combating racist policies, stereotypes and criminalization of immigrants in their community.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "ROP believes in building an all-inclusive movement where personal relationships, shared struggle, and strategic collaboration build a shared agenda and bigger impact.  The following are several of the most significant collaborations for ROP.\r\n\r\nROP is a founding board member of Causa Immigrant Rights Organization and continues today on the board of directors.  We have a long-term relationship with Basic Rights Oregon.  These relationships allows deep partnerships that anticipate the use of wedges to divide identity groups and more creative, cooperative responses that magnify our collective strength.  For example, when ROP\u2019s hometown was challenged in 2008/2009 with two countywide anti-immigrant ballot measures, BRO and Causa stepped in dedicating huge resources, staff time, and campaign leadership to partner with ROP, eventually defeating both measures.  ROP has worked with BRO on the Our Towns campaign building towards a marriage equality ballot measure.\r\n\r\nAnother collaboration is among organizations committed to preventing Wage Theft in Oregon.  The original members of the coalition are NW Workers Justice Project, PCUN, Oregon Center for Public Policy, Voz, and ROP.  That coalition has grown to over 20 groups and is currently working on legislation in the Oregon Legislature and educating workers on their rights.\r\n\r\nIn addition ROP is an active member of ACT for Justice and Dignity, a network of groups fighting police/ICE collaboration, and with the Rights Working Group.  All of these relationships ensure that ROP\u2019s rural strategies are in line with state and national goals to win victories for immigrants, LGBTQ people, and low-income people in Oregon and across the country.", 
    "narrative6": "While our base has historically been representative of the whitest areas of a state in one of the whitest regions in the country, ROP has created a culture that prioritizes racial justice work and the leadership of organizations of color within the state.  We have developed strategic allied relationships with organizations of color in Oregon, such as CAUSA, PCUN, UNETE, Voz, Center for Intercultural Organizing, and APANO that create accountable and coordinated racial justice work.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have held a strong presence in our allies\u2019 work to pass SB 833, the drivers card bill, wage theft protections, and to push for federal immigration reform from all corners of the state.  The CAPACES Leadership Institute, part of the Causa/PCUN family, will host our annual Rural Caucus and Strategy Session this year, and we are incorporating their priorities into our agenda.  This spring, we partnered with Causa in coordinating the March for ONE Oregon that brought a 50-passenger bus on a 5 day trip through of Eastern Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, promoting immigration reform in key Congressional Districts.\r\n\r\nIn the past 4-5 years, our work has begun to incorporate more direct organizing among immigrants and people of color, especially Latinos, in rural Oregon   In 2008 we hired a bilingual, bicultural staff person with experience organizing rural Latinos.  In 2011 we hired one of the leaders from our Latino Advisory Board. Our number of Latino-led human dignity groups has grown to 6.  ROP has built a Latino Advisory Board (LAB), and that committee now has two members who cross-over with the Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nWe have welcomed this internal shift in our membership and leadership, and have dedicated real resources towards not only recruiting and developing leaders of color, but also towards the internal organizational work with our current majority white board, staff and membership.  Through our yearlong strategic planning process, concluding this fall, we have taken time to delve into potential obstacles and make a plan for how to move to the next organizational phase as a multi-cultural organization.  First steps include incorporating racial justice language into our mission, vision, values statement, building understanding of the leadership role of LAB, recruiting more Latino leaders for a stronger presence on our board, and a dismantling racism workshop that will take place on June 9th with our board, staff, and several dozen key ROP members.  We will continue to build a plan that allows us to do our work engaging white people in racial justice (which has been held up as a national model, including in a recent book by Chris Crass), as we expand our base to include the growing rural Latino population.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "In recent years, we've seen a coordinated assault against immigrants through immigration enforcement, the criminal justice system, and homeland security.  Being an immigrant, undocumented, or a person of color has become a criminal offense under state anti-immigrant laws (Arizona, Alabama, Georgia) and unchecked racial profiling runs rampant.  Deportation of undocumented immigrants, regardless of the level of threat they do or don\u2019t pose, has become a top priority of homeland security.\r\n\r\nRecent anti-immigrant ballot measures proposed in 3 rural Oregon counties, the surge in hate crimes, and the high levels of deportations and police impunity demonstrate the lack of basic rights and human compassion for immigrants, who in the dominant narrative are seen as criminals, \u201cillegals,\u201d unworthy of protection, and un-American.\r\n\r\nWe are seeing successes already from the first 2 years of our Safe and Welcoming campaigns: 6 Welcoming Resolutions passed in Lincoln County, our Welcoming min-documentary featuring small-town Latinos and Anglos on how criminalization drives communities apart, conversation happening with over a dozen county sheriffs in the past year by local groups\u2026and are excited to deepen and broaden this work in the coming year.\r\n\r\nWe believe that while immigration reform could have huge positive impacts in the near future, local policies, prejudices, and exclusions of Latinos must be addressed on the local level regardless.  The best way to do this is building the leadership of those most affected, providing legal and community organizing resources, and inviting those groups to take part in a statewide campaign to transform rural Oregon.",

Our mission is to cultivate leadership and build capacity for change, helping communities tap collective wisdom in service of the common good. \r\n\r\nOur accomplishments include:\r\n\r\n\u2022We developed Gracious Space, a core body of work that helps people work better together to address critical issues. CEL has created and used Gracious Space in many sectors including health care, business, government, community, nonprofit, and schools. Resources include two published books, consulting services, and a variety of online resources. Over 15,000 people have used Gracious Space to strengthen their group work.\r\n\r\n\u2022In 2012, we launched the Nourishing Network Institute, which finds new ways to utilize everyone\u2019s gifts of time, talent, relationships, and resources to find community-based solutions to deep-rooted problems, beginning with the problem of hunger. In the first year, we incubated five locally-driven networks in the Puget Sound region, which in turn engaged approximately 800 people and provided an estimated 80,000 meals to at least 600 individuals in their communities. \r\n\r\n\u2022Together with the Institute for Education Leadership and communities throughout the US, we launched the Community Learning Exchange (CLE).

    "narrative3": "There is no question that our communities face tremendous obstacles. Growing income inequality, racial and ethnic divisions, high rates of poverty and joblessness, environmental degradation--the list goes on. People of color and the poor have been disproportionately affected by these challenges. At the heart of things, the true problem is not these listed obstacles, but the institutional racism and oppressive systems that make it so difficult for marginalized community members to succeed in our society.  True solutions, which tackle the deeper causes of these many obstacles, can and should come from within these communities themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe truth is, the more you know about another person\u2019s story, the harder it is to distrust, dislike, or dismiss them.\u201d - Parker Palmer, Center for Courage & Renewal\r\n\r\nSo many times in social change movements, the same patterns of patriarchy, racism, and sexism that we see so prevalent in our society are also part of our movements.  We can be insular and only organize in our own familiar communities, instead of reaching out broadly to build community power. We can tear ourselves apart before having the potential to realize our shared vision. \r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why we don\u2019t hear each others\u2019 stories\u2014racism, classism, and sexism are just a few.  Yet, the act of telling and listening to each others\u2019 stories is at the very core of a just society. Stories honor who we are and our fundamental human dignity. In a just society, all of our stories matter.  To build collective power throughout our society, we must begin by building relationships and trust. We cannot jump into problem-solving and action without taking this time to truly know and respect each other.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Ethical Leadership creates the space for personal transformation, building meaningful relationships that, in turn, advance positive change in communities.  Our programs include guidance in sharing stories and listening deeply so that we can form the strong connections needed for lasting social change. People work across boundaries to cultivate trusting relationships capable of undoing the structures that perpetuate inequities. \r\n\r\nWe build collective power in our communities through an active dedication to collective leadership\u2014a way for diverse groups of people in our communities to collectively hold purpose, direction, and action in  service of the change they have come together to affect.  Collective Leadership is based on the premise that the necessary leadership and answers will emerge from the collective wisdom of a group.  In a collective leadership model, power is shared among people and organizations and the group works across positions and hierarchies.  People tap into wisdom from diverse sources, particularly from those who have been marginalized and previously left out of leadership.  \r\n",

As one of the founding partners of the CLE, the Center for Ethical Leadership works with the national team to plan three learning exchanges a year; helps maintain the online community of support; and seeks financial support for the network. Past CLE participants have helped their communities secure bonds for needed school improvements; boost African American graduation rates; launch immigrant rights programs; and reduce teen pregnancies among other initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Ethical Leadership is also a member of the Non-Profit Anti-Racism Coalition (NPARC) of Seattle.  NPARC is an alliance of organizations and individuals committed to ending institutional racism. It acts as a forum to understand and address the intersection of race, racism and other forms of oppression; share information, resources and best practices; and provide training for members. As a member, we share with and are supported by other Seattle nonprofits working to address both our own internal institutional racism, as well as larger systemic issues.  In partnership with NPARC member organizations and non-member social service organizations, we are applying for a grant to develop an institutional racism assessment tool based on Appreciated Inquiry and Circle processes. The assessment tool will allow people to deepen relationships while providing an overall snapshot of where the organization is on its anti-racism journey.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Despite tremendous strides, racism and its effects still persist today. Anti-racism trainings do valuable work to address the political and historical causes of racism, but even well-meaning efforts often leave participants fearful of talking about race.  \r\n\r\nWe believe that our community\u2019s approach to racial healing is missing a core piece\u2014addressing individual experiences of race and racism, so that we are all equipped to have authentic conversations about race. Deep-rooted and often unrecognized racism is one of the biggest and hardest barriers to break down, but we\u2019ve found tremendous success in overcoming this through our newest project, Changing Racial Relationships. \r\n\r\nUnlike most approaches to addressing racism, CRR is not a training, workshop, or task-oriented meeting. Instead, it is an opportunity for participants to do their own deep personal work regarding race. Using Peacemaking Circles, which are based on ancient wisdom and used by indigenous communities around the world, CRR creates a sacred space that allows people to share without engaging in back and forth dialogue. In 3-day gatherings, CRR emphasizes building trust, listening, speaking our truth, and honoring other\u2019s stories. The experience is deeply transformational, allowing participants to do their own healing, and be witness to the healing within the group.  \r\n\r\nBefore participating in CRR, one member told us, \u201cNormally, I am very guarded when it comes to divulging personal feelings and painful experiences.\u201d But, by the third day, she said, \u201cI felt liberated from my usual tendency to hesitate in sharing such personal thoughts\u2026I was somewhat surprised by my willingness and eagerness to share my personal story.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe know that the struggles our communities face are intertwined, and recognize that racism plays a role in many issues. While CRR is our main program that works directly to address racial justice, most of our programs include a racial justice element. For example, many of the Community Learning Exchanges are hosted by communities of color; one exchange focused on healing the rift between Native American communities and traditional Western education. \r\n\r\nAs a primarily white-led organization focused on increasing social equity and advancing the common good, we prioritize working with communities of color in the designing and shaping of our programs and organizational goals. As white allies in anti-racism work we offer support and experience in leadership development and community change to communities that have defined their own collective goals. Our approach, based on our belief that communities possess the wisdom and knowledge to create change, is never prescriptive. We seek to develop authentic partnerships\u2014the following references can speak to our approach:\r\n",

In coalition with the unhoused, Occupy Eugene, the faith community and other allies, CALC has successfully pushed the cities of Eugene and Springfield to expand their car/tent camping program.  This summer the same coalition will be establishing Opportunity Village Eugene, an eco-village for the unhoused, and working with the Eugene City Council to identify additional locations where people can legally camp.  \r\n~ CALC\u2019s Back to Back Program organized three successful workshops in 2012, the first focused on racism, the second on the shared oppressions of transgender issues and communities of color and the third exploring the issue of class and economic inequities.

    "narrative3": "The major injustices CALC confronts are:  racism, heterosexism, white privilege and white supremacy, economic injustice and disparity, male privilege, and militarism. The root causes of intolerance, hate, bias and blind militarism are: lack of education, minimal exposure to differing opinions, fear of the other, and internalizing the messaging of hate and fear that permeates our society. These biases manifest in numerous ways including blatant hate crimes, institutional oppression, bias through omission, and unconscious bias.  These injustices occur both systemically and circumstantially, in policies and in actions, and by individuals and organizations.  Additionally, evidence shows, there is an inter-relation between intolerance/bias/hate and a society that promotes violence, guns and divisiveness.  Thus, striving to reduce the glorification of the military, war, and violence is also part of creating a just and inclusive world.  \r\nAs a multi-issue organization, we find ourselves working in areas where issues overlap.  Oppressions are connected at a root level and it is often hard to address one issue individually.  For example, in our immigrant rights work, racism obviously is a prevalent bias that is encountered, but immigrants also struggle with economic justice, environmental justice, and class stratification within their populations. In acknowledging the myriad injustices and biases that overlap, it is essential to work with a broad team of allies to address these issues.  We support these allies work through co-hosting events (like annual Tax Day protests with local peace groups and unions, or the rally to support Trayvon Martin which was organized with the local NAACP), promoting their events, monetarily sponsoring their events, attending their events, writing letters of support, lending them our meeting spaces, serving on their boards and advisory committees and becoming members of their organizations.  Conversely, they support CALC in the same ways.   CALC has been able to bring together seemingly incompatible groups and organizations (including churches, conservative elected officials and others) to work together on issues.  CALC\u2019s strategy to change policies, institutions and systems is what we call an \u201cinside\u2013outside\u201d strategy.  We cultivate relationships with individuals inside established power structures, while also mobilizing outside pressure for change through activist leadership, volunteer task forces, joining forces with allies, and bringing community voices to the table. This strategy has been successful in numerous instances.  One recent example is getting city code changed, in both Eugene and Springfield, to allow tents in the legal camping program.  Because injustices are based on need for education and the breaking down of stereotypes, the underlying oppressive structures and beliefs are confronted through educational community events, working with youth, collaboration with a diverse group of allies, creating connections with institutions and government, and continual public messaging through street protests, media outlets, signage, social media and direct mailings.\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative5": "For more than a decade, CALC\u2019s Truth in Recruiting program has partnered with Veterans for Peace (VFP) to educate youth on the realities of military service.  They visit all the high schools in Lane County and on equal footing with military recruiters, they inform youth of the ugly reality of military service. CALC and VFP  have together shown the movie The Invisible War to inform the public of the epidemic of Military Sexual Assault.  Both groups bring resources to this partnership.  The VFP members share their stories -powerful tools in convincing youth that military service is not the same as a video game - while CALC has resources from 47 years of peace work to organize, publicize, and lead this project.  Through this collaboration, both groups are able to have an impact in educating youth and de-glamorizing the military. \r\nThe Lane County Network for Immigrant Integration (LCNII) is a collaboration of more than thirty organizations including institutions, school districts, racial justice groups, social service providers and ally organizations working to create a more welcoming environment for our immigrant neighbors and to promote a more thoughtful public dialogue about immigration. The network\u2019s principles include committing to inclusion and integration, recognizing the contributions of all immigrants to our society, supporting immigrant families, promoting respect and non-discrimination, affirming a common sense approach to public safety, and advancing humane and just national comprehensive immigration reform.  CALC has been part of this network since its inception and continues to be a key-player in organizing and promoting the work of the LCNII.   This group is unique in the broad base of its constituency. It informs and mobilizes a large number of allies in the push for immigration reform nationally, and the successful push for tuition equity and drivers\u2019 licenses for the undocumented in Oregon.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "CALC works toward racial justice on numerous fronts.  We work within collaborations and networks such as the Lane County Network for Immigrant Integration, the Oregon Coalition to Stop Wage Theft and a recent state-wide coalition addressing racial profiling.  These groups recognize that institutional bias disproportionally affects persons of color and that issues such economic injustice, inaccessibility to power and unequal enforcement of laws for all people must be addressed. We work with schools and coordinate educational events like Springfield\u2019s Cesar Chavez Celebration which is in its 14th year and attracts hundreds of community members and a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration, now in it\u2019s16th year, because youth outreach about the valuable contributions of people of color to the fabric of American society is important.  We coordinate workshops like \u201cShared Opressions: Transgender Issues in Communities of Color\u201d, examining the intersections and challenges within and between these communities.  We have an active educational campaign to address the vilification of Arab and Muslim peoples by the media and military.  CALC has spearheaded this discussion through coordinating events like a panel discussion, \u2018The Myth of the Muslim Tide\u2019 and presentation on Minangkabau Muslim Matrilineal Culture.  We will continue to draw attention to the mainstream media\u2019s use of Muslim stereotypes to justify military actions targeting these populations.  Our Stop Hate campaign supports victims of hate crimes and works to inform the public of ways to identify, prevent, or react to crimes of hate or bias.  Often those crimes are based on race.  We always call on ally organizations to partner with us on our Hate Responses.   When a violent racist attack occurred on a young African American male, Springfield City Staff called us to help with a response.  CALC called the NAACP, the ACLU and the school district and quickly mobilized an Anti-Hate rally to show our community solidarity with the victim.  After a shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, we called local Sikh leaders to offer our support and together we organized a vigil and were able to let them know that their community supported them.  CALC plays a key role in a coalition of activists, religious leaders and the unsheltered, that has come together in Eugene and Springfield to advocate for homeless rights, to challenge the oppression directed at the unhoused and to put forth positive images of the unhoused, such as CALC\u2019s Neighbors Without Addresses photo exhibit.  These are just a few ways that we are allies to people of many races and backgrounds, and ways in which we look at the intersections of various oppressions.  \r\n",

Many of our returnees have completed their educational goals up to the master\u2019s degree level. \r\nOpening Doors planned, formed  and began grassroots organizing efforts to create the Montana Coalition for Safety and Justice with  the goal of creating a statewide sustainable organization whose members are organizations working with those most affected by the system.  The Coalition is founded on the vision that many strings can fashion a strong rope and with that rope, great weights can be lifted.  The Montana Coalition for Safety and Justice began to operate in the legislative area in 2011 and has been successful in providing valuable testimony and support for those individuals who came forward to provide information to legislators.  These efforts have resulted in stopping efforts to place barriers to homeownership, housing, employment, access to financial institutions, and social services to families who have a member involved in the criminal justice system.\r\nMontana Coalition for Safety and Justice through its members advocated for legislation that would bring equality of access and remove barriers to a quality life for our constituents.\r\n\r\nOur advocacy efforts have resulted in a legislative study of Parole and Probation, the Coalition hopes to assist constituents in travel and community organization to put a spotlight on policies that re-incarcerate individuals for providing for their families and barring them from meaningful employment and traps children in a system without checks and balances.",

    "narrative3": "The Montana Coalition for Safety and Justice Project addresses the injustice and inequity that pollutes Montana correctional system.  The policies and regulations of the system create barriers and promote failure.  Each year, over 2000 children enter the juvenile justice system in Montana for the first time.  This equates to approximately 20% of the children born each year in Montana.  Many of these children will continue to be in the system as adults.  Some of the recent outcomes of our system can only leave when shaking their head 10-year-olds arrested and given $500,000 bail for missing\u2019s and being disrespectful in school,  15-year-olds being sent to the adult prison and confined to solitary incarceration because it is too dangerous for them to be in the general population due to their age. \r\nOver 60% of the Montana prison population has been re- incarcerated for non-criminal violations of probation or parole.  The Montana parole and probation regulations are, unconstitutional and impossible to follow in many instances.  In Montana, a parolee or probationer can be re-incarcerated because they pay for utilities, which is considered a debt and having debt may be a reason for revocation of a parole or probation.  But failure to provide such necessities for your family is a violation of state law, which would result in re-incarceration. As crazy as it sounds, there are people in prison for going to the hospital, getting married, purchasing a puppy for their children, or simply being Native American.\r\nThe Coalition works to build collective power by organizing its constituency throughout the state in educating and supporting local initiative proposals to end discrimination in housing, education, employment, credit, voter rights and access to financial services solely based on criminal history.  On the state level we are the voice of our community.  In the last year, several of our supporting members who testified before the legislature or physically threatened by members of the parole board and corrections department personnel in an effort to intimidate and bar them from bringing their information to legislative committees.  As a Coalition we provide that voice as a group and protect  those who would be singled out for retribution for bringing their story to light.\r\n\r\nBy organizing it is not the individual that speaks but the organization, as an organization the current power structure can be effectively modified to effect housing, education and employment barriers. The strategy of education combined with organization provides information and incentive to change policies and bias that create long term negative effects on the families and children of ex-prisoners. The Coalition serves as a shield against systemic blatant retribution and intimidation perpetrated by government officials. \r\n",

This will entail gathering data and finishing our study of parole and probation outcomes spanning 10 years.  Final editing and presentation to the committees is scheduled for September 30, 2013.\r\nThe Coalition Project will attend provide comments to appropriate legislative committees and work with those committees to eliminate and reduce barriers to reentry and create a just and equitable system that will empower families and individuals to achieve economic security.  Legislative work is an ongoing task throughout the next year, and such work is done on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.  Our goal in the legislative task force is to have a minimum of three committee bills that remove barriers to reentry.\r\nAt a time appropriate between April and June 2014, it is our goal an intention to organize a day of action at the capital to bring attention to the injustice and the runaway costs of the correctional system.  We propose to highlight that the current policies and system lesson community safety, increases taxpayer cost, without providing any benefit.  Our goal is to have this day attended by a minimum of 100 supporters, constituents and their families.\r\nDuring this timeframe from June to September 2014, work on voter registration and education to encourage our constituency to become an active part of the democratic process.  We will be working during this time, to remove any barriers that we have previously encountered or that we may encounter in registration and encouragement of constituents voters rights.  Our goal in voter rights is to register a minimum of 800 constituent voters. \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Opening Doors is a Part of the Montana Coalition Project and works with other organizations that have similar missions and constituencies to affect positive change.  These partnerships were demonstrated  by coordination of support and advocacy for and against various legislative positions that directly affected our mutual communities.\r\nThe Coalition works to create greater impact by collaborating and focusing the efforts of many organizations to address the issues faced by our mutual members.  Opening Doors works to build a foundation of mutual trust, respect between many organizations  that share similar ideals.  Opening Doors helped re-create the Reentry Task Force for Cascade County to address reentry issues locally and bring local resources to bear.  Opening doors is also worked hard to create long-lasting partnerships with community organizations that provide services and material support to individuals that fit our mutual demographics.  Through these partnerships we've increased the number of satellite food banks and rotation of material goods to organizations that can effectively distribute the materials to those in need.\r\nBecause opening doors has worked in many areas such as food distribution, housing issues, and employment issues, and economic empowerment issues that are not limited to those we serve, opening doors can call on other organizations only worked with to show a unified front for change.\r\nAn example of such a successful collaboration can be found in the coordinated advocacy activities to remove barriers to employment, post incarceration.  This collaboration consisted of the Montana Chamber Of Commerce, Landlords Association National Association for the Mentally Ill and Opening Doors.  Opening doors through the Montana coalition worked with voter registration groups to ensure and encourage our constituency to participate in the election process.  Although our success was not 100% in preventing the denial of the right to vote, we increased constituency turnout and participation.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Our work in correctional system reform includes working on racial justice.  Native Americans are greatly overrepresented in the correctional system.  This overrepresentation is clearly seen at the Montana State women\u2019s prison, where, over 72% of that prisons population is Native American.  By reforming the corrections system and in turn reforming the justice system, opening doors through the Montana coalition project works to organize and educate our elected representatives in the community at large in the disparity of sentencing, parole grants, re-incarceration\u2019s, and law enforcement that statistically shows an unjustifiable focus on individuals based on their racial characteristics.  This is symptomatic of an underlying bias toward individuals of color.\r\nThis unstated bias can also be found in employment data that shows Native Americans and others of color are significantly overrepresented in unemployment and underemployment data.  Because of the disproportionate effect on minorities in employment and incarceration is created and economic injustice that is further compounded by an imbalance in parole and probation restrictions that cannot be justified by the underlying criminal activity.  Minority offenders and their families are often subjected to additional restrictions not imposed on white offenders.\r\nOur efforts to reform the criminal justice system and our inclusion at all levels of our leadership,  those most affected by these biases we give an example through personal action that such biases are unfounded and cannot be justified.  The Coalition has worked hard to volunteer efforts to compile over 10 years of data from parole, probation and criminal Justice statistics that confirm such bias exists.  Opening doors through the Coalition and its partners is working to remove that bias from the system.  By requiring additional Native American and other minority members be appointed to the board of pardons and parole, employed as probation, parole officers, and removing the imposition of conditions of parole that are not connected to the crime.\r\n",

Social agency leaders say \"now is time for collaboration and congregations are needed.\u201d  \r\n\r\nResponding, MIC began in August 2011.  Using Participitory Action Research (PAR), MIC trained leaders in congregations to conduct 32 interviews and 30 focus groups among 27 congregations, across religious traditions.  This research mapped resources and evaluated barriers to collaboration. MIC also conducted needs assessment among 44 social agencies.  Results showed a lack of capacity and trust among congregations and a strong need to organize collaboration.\r\n\r\nMIC empowers congregations and community organizations to work together.  This is accomplished through mapping resources in congregations, community needs assessment and a network of leaders in congregations.  These are used to spawn initiatives by building solidarity among marginalized individuals most affected by issues and people in congregations.  People most affected by the issues maintain 50% leadership in the initiative.\r\n\r\nThus far MIC has:\r\n\u2022\tBuilt a network and organization among 24 congregations.\r\n\u2022\tDeveloped four initiatives addressing issues of hunger, homelessness and sexual violence. \r\n\r\nOn homeless initiatives MIC has:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOrganized leadership with 50% representation from people that have experienced homelessness.\r\n\u2022\tUsed PAR to evaluate and develop training for a homeless outreach program through a homeless shelter. \r\n\u2022\tTrained 15 people that have been homeless and/or from congregations to conduct homeless outreach.

Social agency leaders say \"now is time for collaboration and congregations are needed.\u201d  \r\n\r\nResponding, MIC began in August 2011.  Using Participitory Action Research (PAR), MIC trained leaders in congregations to conduct 32 interviews and 30 focus groups among 27 congregations, across religious traditions.  This research mapped resources and evaluated barriers to collaboration. MIC also conducted needs assessment among 44 social agencies.  Results showed a lack of capacity and trust among congregations and a strong need to organize collaboration.\r\n\r\nMIC empowers congregations and community organizations to work together.  This is accomplished through mapping resources in congregations, community needs assessment and a network of leaders in congregations.  These are used to spawn initiatives by building solidarity among marginalized individuals most affected by issues and people in congregations.  People most affected by the issues maintain 50% leadership in the initiative.\r\n\r\nThus far MIC has:\r\n\u2022\tBuilt a network and organization among 24 congregations.\r\n\u2022\tDeveloped four initiatives addressing issues of hunger, homelessness and sexual violence. \r\n\r\nOn homeless initiatives MIC has:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOrganized leadership with 50% representation from people that have experienced homelessness.\r\n\u2022\tUsed PAR to evaluate and develop training for a homeless outreach program through a homeless shelter. \r\n\u2022\tTrained 15 people that have been homeless and/or from congregations to conduct homeless outreach.  So far providing 495 volunteer hours building relationships, referring individuals to resources and diverting from police interactions. \r\n\u2022\tTrained two individuals previously homeless to give testimony at the Montana Legislature on a bill addressing homelessness among individuals leaving prison.

The generational trauma experienced among native people in Montana results in high levels of substance addiction and mental illness.  When these factors are coupled with lack of access to housing and jobs and quiet yet pervasive racism in Missoula, native people are at much higher risk of homelessness.\r\n\r\nWhile MIC does not currently have a direct focus on addressing racism in Missoula.  MIC places priority on recruiting native people as part of the network of homeless advocates and leadership.  Additionally, intersections of racism and homelessness are included in training the network of advocates and leaders.  Last, MIC has worked to maintain a strong relationship with Missoula Indian Center as to resource native homeless people culturally appropriate services. \r\n",

    "narrative1": "Eastern Washington is dominated by conservative ideologies and powers, from the poverty-producing big-business forces, to Fairchild Air Force Base and its boosters, to the anti-government, anti-tax conservative right. Progressives often feel isolated, silenced, and powerless.  \r\n\r\nBut Spokane's power and potential is great. Former Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown tells the story of how Employment Non-Discrimination became law after years of defeats: the key change came when Spokane voters sustained a city-based law prohibiting anti-gay discrimination. Brown cited that vote to assure legislators from other non-I-5 districts: Since it was sustained in Spokane, it would be safe in their districts too! \r\n\r\nWhen we win here, it opens the doors to victories statewide. Investing to build grassroots political power in Eastern Washington is the smartest way to invest in changing our state's political landscape. \r\n\r\nFounded in 1975 based on principles of nonviolence, PJALS engages everyday people to build a just and nonviolent world through community organizing and grassroots leadership development for human rights, economic justice, and peace. \r\n\r\nOur recent accomplishments:\r\n-Winning a 70% Yes vote for Police Accountability in Feb 2013, a mark of our success in mobilizing public demand to end police abuse.\r\n-Helping end a big bank tax loophole that drained millions from Washington's budget and caused cuts that disproportionately hurt low-income families and people of color. We mobilized increasingly larger delegations to Olympia and in-district for legislator meetings, protests, and media coverage.\r\n-Establishing the largest leadership development and relationship-weaving gathering in the Inland Northwest: our annual Peace and Economic Justice Action Conference draws nearly 200 participants for skill-building and energizing speakers who inspire grassroots activists to take action together on critical issues facing Eastern WA. \r\n-Developing the leadership and skills of progressive young activists through our Young Activist Leaders Program, graduating our second class in June 2013.",

Because we are organizing and demonstrating the power and will of underrepresented people in Eastern Washington, PJALS's victories serve as a bellwether of the possibilities for statewide change.

    "narrative3": "Our campaigns address tax justice, prioritizing human needs over war-making, police accountability, alternatives to incarceration. The twin \u201csacred cows\u201d of tax loopholes for the top 1% and our country\u2019s bloated military budget have reduced resources for the needs of Spokane's disproportionately low-income families, exacerbating persistent racial and economic inequities in resources and opportunities. Our \"criminal justice\" system is militarized, violent, and disproportionately harms people of color and the mentally ill. \r\n\r\nThese issues are rooted in the ideologies and structures of militarism, racism, and corporate dominance, perpetuated by the undemocratic imbalance of power. \r\n\r\nTo address root causes, we are building the collective power of everyday people with a movement that connects the dots between corporate dominance, militarism that wastes life and resources, and poverty of low-income families.  \r\n\r\nTo impact state policy or the positions of statewide electeds, we organize strong civic participation and leadership from Eastern WA. For example, with the opportunity of the Sequestration and budget priority fight and Senator Murray's key Senate committee positions, we delivered over 1100 petitions and shared personal stories demanding cuts to Pentagon spending to protect human needs programs. Defense-related spending accounts for nearly half of all federal spending. Now, Murray's proposed budget calls for greater Pentagon cuts than President Obama's proposals. We believe that her awareness of Eastern Washington support increased her willingness to lead on Pentagon cuts. \r\n\r\nOur central power-building strategy is to engage everyday people across issues, with four essential pillars: \r\n \r\n-Exercising Core Strength and Building Our Base in Key Districts: In districts where we have many members, we mobilize and develop strong leaders. In key districts where we have fewer members, we mobilize existing members to recruit and develop new activists and leaders. We have increasingly turned our attention to organizing in more conservative districts. \r\n \r\n-Increasing Rural Progressive Power and Capacity: We followed the successful model of Oregon's Rural Organizing Project to, PJALS established a communication network with more than a dozen small peace and human rights groups across Eastern WA. In 2009, we organized 11 meetings on tax reform in 6 counties and increased our contacts dramatically. We will continue building on key established relationships in 2014.\r\n \r\n-Building Inclusive Coalitions: In all our policy-impact work, we help build broad coalitions in partnership with communities of color, low-income, and GLBT communities for shared goals including revenue and budget priorities, police accountability, and alternatives to incarceration.  \r\n\r\n- Leadership Development: We strengthen the skills, analysis, capacity, and relationships of youth leaders, our members, and other grassroots community activists through our Community Organizing internships, Young Activist Leaders Program, annual Action Conference, and other programming.\r\n\r\nUsing these pillars, we increase relationships, increase grassroots civic engagement, deepen analysis, and build power while advancing policy change. \r\n",

    "narrative5": "PJALS' Inland Northwest Death Penalty Abolition Group (INDPAG) is collaborating with Safe & Just Alternatives, the ACLU-led campaign to repeal WA's death penalty. Washington's death penalty is disproportionately applied to African Americans (4 of 8 on WA death row) and low-income people. INDPAG acts as the Eastern Washington subcommittee of the campaign, gathering endorsements from faith leaders and communities of color, holding public education & recruitment events, conducting community outreach, and participating in statewide planning. Just in 2012, SJA has already made significant progress, delivering 3000 postcards to legislators (over 600 from Spokane) and achieving the first-ever House Committee hearing. Due to this collaboration, we are mobilizing constituents of key legislators; three Eastern Washington legislators co-sponsored the bill for the first time. This collaboration demonstrates that grassroots engagement in Eastern Washington is a winning strategy on a key state and national justice issue. \r\n\r\nWe have partnered with Washington CAN! for more than three years around our shared priorities of closing corporate tax loopholes in WA. Each organization has shared resources in our partnership: we share office space with them; WACAN includes PJALS delegations in its buses to Olympia. We've mobilized constituents, both in-district and in Olympia, to meet with legislators and protest for closing corporate tax loopholes and rejecting cuts that disproportionately hurt low-income children, families, and people of color. We successfully closed a state tax loophole for big banks that drained tens of millions of revenue dollars annually. We have assisted with each others' leadership development events. Our partnership has expanded  to include Pentagon cuts work; we have coordinated actions targeting our Congressional delegation to convey pressure from all parts of the state. This partnership is a great example of a successful statewide collaboration that is impacting policy and increasing capacity of both organizations. ", 
    "narrative6": "Our work for human rights, economic justice, and peace is based on our analysis that violence goes beyond individual acts to include ideologies, systems, and structures that perpetuate oppression, exploitation, and privilege. We are united by our commitment to nonviolent collective action to shift power and create change. \r\n\r\nOur work as a racial justice ally organization is based on relationship-building, shared issue work, reflection on and learning about our role, and consistency. We do internal work such as reading/discussion series and anti-racism trainings to build our analysis, but our focus and emphasis is on calling people to action. \r\n\r\nBased on the results of a racial justice organizational assessment, our Racial Justice & Equity Workplan sets goals for our policy-impact organizing, relationship-building for leadership and accountability, and our leadership development programs. \r\n\r\nIn our policy work, we use a racial equity lens and messaging frame in our work for revenue, militarism, smart justice, police accountability,  death penalty repeal, and LGBT equality. For example, we have twice hosted the Spokane release of WACAN!'s Racial Justice Report Card. Our work for marriage equality included organizing LGBT people of color and allies to endorse and publicly speak out. In our militarism work, we discuss how economic scarcity and fear for security has been used to manipulate racist fears of \"dangerous\" \"others: and fuel policies of war and militarism. \r\n\r\nAs a primarily white organization in a 90% white region, we consciously maintain accountability to people of color through building strong relationships with leaders and groups based in those communities. In particular, we have been working with EWU's Chicano student group MEChA to support their organizing for immigration reform. We have a long-term relationship with the Spokane NAACP. We are strengthening relationships with Native leaders and with other African American leaders through our participation in the Smart Justice campaign. Our relationship-building is based on listening and consistency in our actions. \r\n\r\nIn our leadership development work, we offer opportunities to deepen knowledge and build skills around issues of racial equity, white privilege, and anti-racist organizing. Our Young Activist Leaders Program includes a fall retreat on Identity, Privilege, and Oppression and a workshop on Challenging Oppressive Statements. We set YALP recruitment goals for youth of color. In our Action Conference, we prioritize workshops with a racial equity lens and workshops that meet the needs of all-volunteer organizations because many groups based in communities of color are very low-capacity. Our Steering Committee (board) has completed a reading/discussion series and a Moving Racial Justice Workshop; we'll participate in another in summer 2013. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to consistent action as allies and willingness to reflect on mistakes and opportunities to learn and improve.

Our 550 member households, 100 active volunteers, and nearly 2000 supporters are disproportionately low-income and middle-class families, GLBT folks, and retirees. We have increased youth participation recently. Our board members bring life experience as low-income, queer, veterans, women, Native, and young activists. Member priority surveys guide our strategic planning. Our members lead the organization through committees that plan campaigns and events. As a primarily white, multi-class organization in a 90% white region, we consciously maintain accountability to people of color, low-income,  and GLBT people through strong relationships with leaders and groups based in those communities, partnering on shared issues (such as revenue and budget, police accountability, alternatives to incarceration, and others) and building inclusive coalitions.",

SAGE began by assisting efforts of low-wage hotel and janitorial workers to win a better standard of living for their families. In 2006, SAGE built and led a coalition of 17 organizations that won community benefits in exchange for up zoning new downtown Seattle development.

    "narrative3": "The Puget Sound economy is growing once again, but low income workers, immigrants and communities of color are not benefiting from economic growth. Area employers are improving profitability by cutting labor costs and low wage workers are paying a steep price. At SeaTac Airport for example, passenger service, ground support and food & retail service workers work for poverty-level wages and lack adequate health insurance coverage. Likewise seaport truckers are misclassified by their employers as contract workers when they meet legal definitions of full-time employees. As a result they not only earn poverty wages, but are forced into unhealthy work conditions that are the modern day equivalent of \u201csweatshops on wheels.\u201d\r\n\r\nLow income and communities of color are not only facing institutional injustice in the workforce they are also threatened by gentrification and displacement in the neighborhoods they live in. Although people of color grew by 47 percent as a share of the population in King County, low income people in the neighborhoods of the Rainier Valley grew by only 5 percent, while the white population grew by 17 percent. Economic growth anticipated along the light rail line in the valley threatens to displace low income communities of color whose incomes will not keep up as real estate costs rise. Multiple factors make Rainier Valley households susceptible for displacement, including concentrated poverty, high numbers of renters, high rates of foreclosure, high unemployment, and over-representation in low-wage jobs.\r\n\r\nBuilding the labor movement and building community capacity are core to Sage\u2019s theory of change. We play a unique role in bring together labor, community, faith and environmental organizations to build lasting movements for social change. Our Goods Movement and Ports Campaign is partnering with local unions to support airport and seaport workers who are seeking to unionize, negotiate contracts and pass public policies that promote living wage jobs, job retention and benefits. Our Community Benefits and Development Campaign is working to ensure that low income and communities of color have a seat at decision-making tables concerning economic development and transit access in the Rainier Valley. In both these campaigns we will build alignment among regional progressive entities that focuses on long-term power building and agenda setting rather than short-term campaign wins. We strengthen our relationships with a growing circle of trusted allies in the environmental, immigrant rights, faith, housing and other sectors and leverage those relationships to be a stronger, collective political force to build a coalition that works together on a progressive pro-worker and community agenda. Our strategic goal is a governing progressive coalition, not within one organization, but within closely aligned strategic partnerships, driving a progressive agenda.",

Our strategic plan completed in November 2012 calls for a multi-year program of racial justice training and program development, which includes the adoption of organizational policy for staff and board diversity as well as a program for the active recruitment, training and support of leaders of color.\r\n\r\nOur initiatives seek not only to make tangible gains in wages, benefits, quality of life and policy, but we seek to help constituencies build the political and social power to fight for real change in their own lives. One of the ways we do this is through leadership development. We seek always to place the people directly affected by the issues in the driver\u2019s seat of our organizing work by cultivating their leadership, and by investing in them through training and leadership opportunities. We also work in close partnership with organizations and alliances representing the interests of diverse communities in the region.

At Right 2 Survive, we work to educate people about the root causes of homelessness, including the steep and steady decline in public assistance, lack of work opportunities, a shortage of affordable housing, no access to health insurance, and myriad other factors that deepen the cycle of poverty.\r\n\r\nThe trend to criminalize houseless folks only worsens the problem by putting more money into incarceration, instead of housing and other vital services.  Many people lose their only worldly possessions, identification, medications, sleeping bags, tarps and tents, during sweeps by the police.  Lacking secure storage for their belongings, houseless people are easy targets for theft, and find it difficult to apply for jobs when carrying bedding and other necessities.  Others lose opportunities for jobs and housing when they are jailed for carrying out survival activities such as sleeping outside on public or private land, defecating or urinating outside when there is no access to restrooms, asking for money to get something to eat or a room for the night, and sitting on a sidewalk to rest.\r\n\r\nRight 2 Survive builds collective power through action.  We use our experiences to build analysis and solidarity, and organize together to challenge unjust laws and policies, while creating safe places for our members to gather, grow, and learn. \r\n\r\nOver the past three and a half years, Right 2 Survive has been working diligently to build leadership and challenge the power dynamics where those without direct experience are constantly told what the solutions are, instead of being asked what are the solutions?  We are working on multiple levels to address this inequity.  One of our collaborative projects, The Oregon Homeless Bill of Rights, will reassert basic civil and human rights and effectively challenge discriminatory policies, such as the sidewalk management plan, and the camping ban.  In order for local governments to comply with the Homeless Bill of Rights legislation, they will need to fund and support the creation of dignified alternatives for the houseless community.  For example, instead of criminalizing someone for performing bodily functions, the government will be required to set up hygiene centers with bathrooms and showers.  Instead of ticketing someone for sleeping in public, the right to sleep will be protected, and the solution of how to provide safe places to sleep will be a necessity.  As it is now, whenever the houseless are swept from under bridges and other camping spots, the only reply to \u201cWhere do we go?\u201d is deafening silence, or a pair of handcuffs.  We aim to change that.\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative1": "Seattle Young People's Project (SYPP) is a youth-led, adult-supported social change organization that empowers youth ages 13-18 to express themselves and take action on the issues that affect their lives. Society continues to blame and scapegoat youth for dropping out, gang violence, and juvenile justice involvement, and often fails to address these issues' root causes. Decisions are being made by administrators and \"experts\" while excluding youth voices and those their decisions impact from conversations. SYPP supports young people to build their power as agents of social change in their communities through grassroots organizing. SYPP offers historically marginalized youth -- often on the front lines of the most transformative social movements -- a space to expand their skills, self-confidence, and their consciousness.\r\n\r\nSince our founding in 1992, SYPP has been a home base for youth organizers who want to transform the unjust policies and cultures of their schools and communities. SYPP is and continues to be very unique in the space we build and foster. SYPP youth's major accomplishments include designing and leading campaigns for culturally relevant curriculum (2002-2004), organizing against sexual harassment in school (2002-2004), against racist mascots (1999-2000), and for queer youth rights (1992-present). Our current effort, the Education Justice Campaign (EJC), began in 2006 to fight the use of the institutionally racist Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) as a graduation requirement. The EJC mobilized over 1000 students through a variety of creative organizing tactics that magnified the public outcry, precipitating the WASL replacement in 2009. Our analysis and organizing work have now broadened to address the School-to-Prison Pipeline (described in more detail below).\r\n\r\nOur greatest accomplishment is supporting and creating community organizers--another generation of movement leaders, organizing for a better world. SYPP alum have gone on to help lead social and environmental justice efforts among other things. ",

    "narrative3": "In order to undo the STPP and the structurally racist inequalities at its source, we need: 1) coordinated, local campaign work that is community-based, focused on root causes, and led by youth and parents and 2) opportunities for marginalized youth to experience nourishing, lifelong community involvement while simultaneously earning a needed wage that allows them to forgo other employment. While nationally young people and the progressive movement are working to dismantle these unjust structures, regionally, SYPP is among the few organizations doing this work with the people most impacted as leaders. Our youth are currently targeting school push out, including zero tolerance discipline policies and racial disparities in graduation rates.\r\n\r\nSYPP addresses the criminalization of low-income communities and communities of color by providing young people -- most of them targets of criminalization -- with the knowledge and skills they need to dismantle the systems and policies that push them and other youth like them into the criminal legal system. We offer space, support, and a leadership development framework that involves youth in organizational governance and operational decisions, and structures our programming along a Social Justice Leadership Pipeline (SJLP). SJLP is an alternative to the STPP that offer multi-year leadership training. Young organizers build critical thinking skills, identify root causes of injustice in their communities, utilize organizing strategies and tactics while building their own power and leadership.\r\n\r\nSYPP utilizes popular education, collective action, and strategic influence to change the root causes of the STPP by remaking and removing the attitudes and policies that fuel it, and by developing leaders among those it most impacts. By fostering, promoting, and sustaining youth leadership, SYPP also deconstructs stereotypes that paint them as dropouts, delinquents, and criminals. Our goal this year is to continue and build off our work at bringing restorative justice into Seattle Schools.\r\n\r\nOur want is to continue to invest in the education and community awareness around the STPP and continue our involvement in bringing restorative justice into Seattle Schools, particularly since there is continued excitement and energy on many levels including the Superintendent of Seattle Public Schools. Due to shifts and transitioning of co-directors, moving to a new location, and new young folks coming through SYPP, we're noticing that these have had direct impacts on SYPP work and campaign energy. Because of these shifts we will be holding an intentional Membership Retreat to revisit the direction of SYPP in terms of campaigns, financial resources and focus, and processes around membership and leadership development and developing a SYPP strategic plan for the next three years. \r\n",

We are directly involved in the Race and Social Justice Subcommittee that is involved with training and support of the RJ pilot at Cleveland H.S. We aim to organize young folks at Cleveland so that they too understand RJ and their agency in the process. We will continue to partake in conferences, such as the Seattle Race Conference focused on the STPP and impacts of structural racism in Seattle Public Schools, and lead workshops through Project Liberation about the STPP.\r\n\r\nThrough our continued youth organizing we aim to increase ongoing youth participation and ownership of SYPP so that young folks feel and know that SYPP is theirs.

    "narrative5": "Education Justice Collaborations:\r\n\r\n- Community Justice Network for Youth (CJNY): a national network of organizations fighting for the rights of youth in the juvenile justice system and to the end of the School-to-Prison Pipeline.\r\n- Subcommittee on Racial Disproportionality in Discipline Rates in Education: part of the Race and Social Justice Community Roundtable of over 20 Seattle organizations.\r\n\r\nThrough active participation in both, SYPP has leveraged meetings with school officials, collaborated on a restorative discipline pilot for Cleveland High School, strengthened the strategic positioning of our youth-led campaign, and used national resources to inform local action. The Subcommittee, like the City of Seattle Roundtable, is a multi-sector strategy and approach, meaning we have the investment and participation of various stakeholders in the non-profit, local government, and public schools sectors which is a strategic systemic approach to institutionalizing and creating change.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "SYPP made a critical shift to become an anti-racist and anti-oppression organization in the late 1990s after members and staff participated in a series of transformational Undoing Institutional Racism workshops. The shift included intensive staff, board, and youth trainings on organizational change, undoing institutional racism, and white privilege. This resulted in a deep and practiced commitment and accountability to the leadership of youth of color, low-income, young women, LGBTQ youth, and to shared principles of anti-racist and anti-oppression organizing. SYPP continues to practice this commitment throughout our infrastructure and personnel today: our projects, outreach strategies, hiring practices, and the social change we seek to prioritize the needs and experiences of youth living at the intersections of these identities and experiences. Because how often do marginalized youth receive or supported or valued with access and opportunities to build their own leadership that is youth centered and driven? To also build power, means to envision something different and something more liberatory than what we live in today. We're building on anti-racism and anti-oppression values towards envisioning: where do we want to go and what do we want to build! Which builds off of and moves us from survival and resistance to growth and thriving because we are inherently worth so much more.\r\n\r\nSYPP recognizes that young folks are often labeled and placed into assumed identities and roles without their consent. In response, we prioritize development of young people's abilities to define their futures for themselves by supporting their own growth, skills building and critical thinking. Our vision is to expand roles of youth within the social justice movement and to support the long-term growth of not only youth organizers but people committed to a lifetime of envisioning and building towards another world.\r\n\r\nSYPP is building a pipeline for youth in our community to become leaders in social justice movements that emotionally, intellectually, and financially sustains them to work as community organizers over a lifetime. We envision a more liberatory and life sustaining system(s) that no longer calculates future prison beds based on test scores but rather plans for the ever-growing number of youth leaders ready and committed to community organizing and social justice change. SYPP is directly contributing to this impact by supporting youth in ongoing and engaged leadership beyond short-term periods of community organizing and other fragmented opportunities for leadership such as summer volunteer work or community service required for school. Young folks engage in long-term meaningful ways on average for three to four years with SYPP.\r\n\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "According to Seattle Public Schools, in recent years, African American, Latino/a, and Native American teens have been 2-5 times more likely to be suspended and expelled than their White peers. In elementary school, African American youth are suspended 9 times more frequently than their White peers. In middle school, 1 in 4 Native American and 1 in 3 Samoan youth are suspended. In 2010, of the over 1,000 high school seniors dropped out or unable to graduate on time, 75% were youth of color. Studies show youth who drop our are 3.5 times more likely to end up in the criminal justice system [Coalition for Juvenile Justice, Abandoned in the Back Row: New Lessons in Education and Delinquency Prevention, 2 (2001)]\r\n\r\nAt the center of these figures are intersecting policies, practices, and unjust funding priorities that create a School-to-Prison Pipeline (STPP), a systemic channel that tracks marginalized youth out of the school system and into cycles of poverty and incarceration. In Seattle and King County, the STPP is growing through closures of schools serving youth of color, slashed funding to social and emotional support structures such as academic counseling, a maze of alternative discipline and remedial tracks, anti-gang legislation that target youth of color, increased violence against youth, and a de-funding and de-prioritization of district-level racial and social justice work. Youth with learning/cognitive and physical disabilities and youth who's primary language isn't English are vulnerable to unjust discipline practices. STPP organizing centers young people's thoughts and solutions to unjust school disciplinary practices. This translates to much larger issues such as school climate and to what's being learned/taught in classrooms. Where based on fourth grade reading scores future prison beds and cells are calculated, this is a crisis of racial and social justice for youth, families, and our communities.",

    "narrative1": "Before 1996 repressive tactics by immigration officials and local police discouraged day laborers from seeking work on the corners of 3 major intersections in Portland, OR. Day laborers thus began to organize, and found they shared common incidences of exploitation, wage theft, and homelessness. In 1998 the Day Laborer Project, a project of the Workers\u2019 Organizing Committee, formed. Through strategic grassroots organizing and advocacy efforts, the Day Laborer Project successfully ended all I.C.E. raids on these intersections in the Central Eastside Industrial District and successfully began reclaiming stolen wages. As the Day Laborer Project built momentum and continued to empower other day laborers, the project separated from the Workers\u2019 Organizing Committee and in 2000 grew into Voz Workers\u2019 Rights Education Project (Voz).\r\n\r\nA plan finally emerged approved by the City of Portland in 2006 that included the establishment of a worker center, and Voz led the advocacy efforts for this unprecedented safe space. The Martin Luther King Jr. Worker Center finally opened in 2008. Voz was chosen by then City of Portland Mayor Tom Potter to operate the center and has been doing so every since. The MLK Jr. Worker Center offers a safe space for workers to find work, build community, increase their employability, and grow as community leaders. The center also provides opportunities for day laborers to build collective power, organize for their rights and have their voices heard through direct advocacy to policy-decision-makers. Day laborer community leaders unify and strengthen their families and community through working with Voz, transforming their own realities and progressing immigrant and workers\u2019 rights. \r\n\r\nSome Major Accomplishments:\r\n1.\tReclaimed more than $350,000 in wages since 2000.\r\n2.\tGenerated over 16,000 jobs since 2008.\r\n3.\tDecreased the collaboration between Police and ICE in Multnomah County with A.C.T.

    "narrative3": "Day laborers are among the most economically vulnerable of the immigrant community because of irregular and hazardous work available to them and because of the high percentages of wage theft cases among them. On the street, day laborers face exploitation, homelessness, and wage theft. On the street they are also often targets for violent crimes such as armed robbery and hate-motivated assaults. Many day laborers migrate here to escape political persecution and/or economic injustice caused by globalization and US foreign and trade policies. Frustration with the high unemployment rate in Oregon is often directed at immigrants, particularly those who fit a stereotype of \u201cillegal\u201d. \r\n\r\nOur work is tied to national and global struggles for human rights and a just society. Immigration is a truly global issue. As our partners at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) suggest, we see the day laborers not as a problem but as a cultural phenomenon that reflects the complexity of our identities and the oppressions that we seek to overcome. National organizations rely on Voz to bring workers\u2019 voices to the table and to empower workers to effect change in the wider community.\r\n\r\nVoz is dedicated to achieving justice for low-wage immigrant workers, and because of this we must challenge racism, classism, and nativism as a crucial element of our work. We encourage day labor organizers to think critically about how their local efforts connect to broader struggles so that they are strengthened by the power and solidarity of the global movement. This knowledge emboldens our leaders, giving them confidence to believe in their ability to affect true social change. We seek to empower workers to defend themselves by uniting and working together. Day laborers become less vulnerable to abuse when they know their rights and when they educate and support each other through actions such as adhering to a community minimum wage. We then instill policies that support their efforts like requiring employers to pay a minimum wage ($12) at the MLK Jr. Worker Center. \r\nWe know direct-action advocacy efforts change institutional structures that cause the realities faced by day laborers. Thus day laborers attend conversations we have with city, county, and state policy-makers. Voz is a crucial community convener in the movement for day laborer rights community. Organizing activities are primarily located at the MLK Worker Center. Critical to the ongoing movement toward social justice, Voz provides disenfranchised day laborers with the opportunities and support to become leaders, to organize for their rights and to lend their voices to state and national policy decisions.

    "narrative5": "Voz is a founding group of the Safe Communities Project founded in 2010, charged with ending Police/ICE Collaborations in Multnomah County. This project became the Activists Coming Together for Justice and Dignity Network, or, A.C.T. Network in 2011. Voz is a leader in the network because we ensure those directly affected by Police/I.C.E. Collaborations are at the table with decision makers, including Multnomah County Sheriff Dan Staton, County Chair Jeff Cogen, and other county commissioners. We have also seen the network grow over the years to include the faith community, legal groups, and other social justice organizations because of day labor outreach and Voz community impact. We strategically planned and coordinated press conferences, rallies, and actions within each of our constituencies that proved successful in decreasing Police/ICE collaboration in Multnomah county. This victory has strengthened our network and engaged day laborers more than ever before in their communities. Our ultimate goal in this network is to end all Police collaboration with ICE and as Voz's capacity increases, so does that of the network. \r\n\r\nVoz is a leader in the coalition to Stop Wage Theft Now! in Oregon. We have consistently brought day laborer voices to the capital to change wage theft policies. The progress the coalition has made towards educating legislators about the realities workers face regarding wage theft would not have happened without Voz\u2019s connection with the day laborer community. The coalition includes other social justice organizations, churches, foundations, and legislative allies. This collaboration helps build an effective labor movement because each organization appeals to legislators differently. The coalition works directly with key legislators in the House Business and Labor Committee to track, edit, and revise 3 bills. So far, 1 is still moving forward, HB 2976, that would provide clarity around who is responsible for employees and wages.", 
    "narrative6": "Voz is committed to an inclusive process that secures the rights and empowerment of all Portland\u2019s day laborers. When we are educating allies and the broader Portland community about day labor struggles, we integrate our analysis about how inequality and oppression play out in the immigration debate. The international labor movement especially compliments racial justice movements because all immigrants come from varying cultures, geographic regions, economies, education levels, and health circumstances that are directly correlated with race. \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of day laborers are men, and while we work to protect immigrant rights, we also dismantle sexism in our work and among those we organize. We work with the Latino Sexual Health Coalition who has provided our staff with trainings that confront hetero-normative stereotypes, and various stigmas relating to gender and sexuality. A statement of equity and safety is prominently reiterated by board members in the center and trainings curriculum include a mandatory workshop specifically devoted to gender justice. The popular education techniques used to run all meetings, workshops and assemblies enable inclusion from all who are present so that we can continue to combine our racial justice work with our economic justice work. Facilitators ensure that the ground rules for meetings and workshops foster respect for differences and the inclusion of underrepresented communities.\r\n\r\nWhen immigration rights movements only address issues of visibility (on street corners), mainstream partnerships, health and safety concerns, they ignore critical social, political, cultural and economic disparities that erode the human rights of workers everywhere. While solving issues of employability, Voz places issues of oppression and racial injustices at the forefront of all of our work.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "Our work addresses the root causes of the criminalization of immigrants using solutions proposed and implemented by immigrant workers themselves. Local police have become a primary gateway to deportation which seriously threats our public safety and civil rights. Police can get distracted from their primary functions, resources can get diverted, and trust with immigrant communities is broken when local police forces collaborate with I.C.E. Our strategies for moving criminal justice forward impact the movement at two main levels:\r\n\r\n1. Culturally relevant organizing that combat internalized isms that paralyze and prevent immigrant workers from trusting local law enforcement. Without trust, crimes go unreported, investigations go unsolved, decades of community policing efforts are destroyed, and we are all less safe. Also as a direct result, cases of domestic violence and other health-related situations are going un-reported.Families are not only torn apart through this collaboration, but the pursuit of the American Dream becomes a path towards the criminalization of immigrants.  We organize workers on the street, one-on-one, and in the center towards empowerment and direct-action advocacy to make change.\r\n\r\n2. Direct action advocacy and civic engagement efforts to combat institutions & structures that criminalize honest workers and tear apart families. We bring day laborers directly to decision makers, train workers on public speaking, and politicize day laborers through Popular Education methodology leadership trainings. Voz brings these voices to the A.C.T. Network\u2019s actions, rallies, and planning meetings, including day laborers and immigrant workers in this conversation. We also directly work with families of those deported to provide work history and other relevant documents to the Tacoma detention center. Often times these documents act as a point of reference for detained workers and expedite the release process. Immigrant workers who have themselves or their family members been detained lead these advocacy efforts. \r\n",

Decisions are being made by administrators and \"experts\" while excluding youth voices and those their decisions impact from conversations.

SYPP offers historically marginalized youth -- often on the front lines of the most transformative social movements -- a space to expand their skills, self-confidence, and their consciousness.\r\n\r\nSince our founding in 1992, SYPP has been a home base for youth organizers who want to transform the unjust policies and cultures of their schools and communities. SYPP is and continues to be very unique in the space we build and foster. SYPP youth's major accomplishments include designing and leading campaigns for culturally relevant curriculum (2002-2004), organizing against sexual harassment in school (2002-2004), against racist mascots (1999-2000), and for queer youth rights (1992-present). Our current effort, the Education Justice Campaign (EJC), began in 2006 to fight the use of the institutionally racist Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) as a graduation requirement. The EJC mobilized over 1000 students through a variety of creative organizing tactics that magnified the public outcry, precipitating the WASL replacement in 2009. Our analysis and organizing work have now broadened to address the School-to-Prison Pipeline (described in more detail below).\r\n\r\nOur greatest accomplishment is supporting and creating community organizers--another generation of movement leaders, organizing for a better world.

    "narrative3": "In order to undo the STPP and the structurally racist inequalities at its source, we need: 1) coordinated, local campaign work that is community-based, focused on root causes, and led by youth and parents and 2) opportunities for marginalized youth to experience nourishing, lifelong community involvement while simultaneously earning a needed wage that allows them to forgo other employment. While nationally young people and the progressive movement are working to dismantle these unjust structures, regionally, SYPP is among the few organizations doing this work with the people most impacted as leaders. Our youth are currently targeting school push out, including zero tolerance discipline policies and racial disparities in graduation rates.\r\n\r\nSYPP addresses the criminalization of low-income communities and communities of color by providing young people -- most of them targets of criminalization -- with the knowledge and skills they need to dismantle the systems and policies that push them and other youth like them into the criminal legal system. We offer space, support, and a leadership development framework that involves youth in organizational governance and operational decisions, and structures our programming along a Social Justice Leadership Pipeline (SJLP). SJLP is an alternative to the STPP that offer multi-year leadership training. Young organizers build critical thinking skills, identify root causes of injustice in their communities, utilize organizing strategies and tactics while building their own power and leadership.\r\n\r\nSYPP utilizes popular education, collective action, and strategic influence to change the root causes of the STPP by remaking and removing the attitudes and policies that fuel it, and by developing leaders among those it most impacts. By fostering, promoting, and sustaining youth leadership, SYPP also deconstructs stereotypes that paint them as dropouts, delinquents, and criminals. Our goal this year is to continue and build off our work at bringing restorative justice into Seattle Schools.\r\n\r\nOur want is to continue to invest in the education and community awareness around the STPP and continue our involvement in bringing restorative justice into Seattle Schools, particularly since there is continued excitement and energy on many levels including the Superintendent of Seattle Public Schools. Due to shifts and transitioning of co-directors, moving to a new location, and new young folks coming through SYPP, we're noticing that these have had direct impacts on SYPP work and campaign energy. Because of these shifts we will be holding an intentional Membership Retreat to revisit the direction of SYPP in terms of campaigns, financial resources and focus, and processes around membership and leadership development and developing a SYPP strategic plan for the next three years. \r\n",

We are directly involved in the Race and Social Justice Subcommittee that is involved with training and support of the RJ pilot at Cleveland H.S. We aim to organize young folks at Cleveland so that they too understand RJ and their agency in the process. We will continue to partake in conferences, such as the Seattle Race Conference focused on the STPP and impacts of structural racism in Seattle Public Schools, and lead workshops through Project Liberation about the STPP.\r\n\r\nThrough our continued youth organizing we aim to increase ongoing youth participation and ownership of SYPP so that young folks feel and know that SYPP is theirs. Through T4T and our summer YO!, we'll build a basis with new and current SYPP youth to then forward existing as well as new campaigns.", 
    "narrative5": "Education Justice Collaborations:\r\n\r\n- Community Justice Network for Youth (CJNY): a national network of organizations fighting for the rights of youth in the juvenile justice system and to the end of the School-to-Prison Pipeline.\r\n- Subcommittee on Racial Disproportionality in Discipline Rates in Education: part of the Race and Social Justice Community Roundtable of over 20 Seattle organizations.\r\n\r\nThrough active participation in both, SYPP has leveraged meetings with school officials, collaborated on a restorative discipline pilot for Cleveland High School, strengthened the strategic positioning of our youth-led campaign, and used national resources to inform local action. The Subcommittee, like the City of Seattle Roundtable, is a multi-sector strategy and approach, meaning we have the investment and participation of various stakeholders in the non-profit, local government, and public schools sectors which is a strategic systemic approach to institutionalizing and creating change.\r\n\r\nBeyond working with these two particular organizations, we've fostered and created other collaborations as well. SYPP has been attending Washington Incarceration Stops Here (WISH), who's current focus is to stop King County's plans to build a new youth jail.\r\n\r\nwe're also working more closely with several other youth centered organizations, Youth Speaks Seattle (YSS), Queer Youth Space (QYS), youth programming staff at API Chaya, and Anakbayan. We see our work as vital and interrelated. We all work with different and overlapping communities of young people. We see it as powerful and supportive for us to work together, strengthen one another, share and be strategic with one another, as well as support one each others work. ", 
    "narrative6": "SYPP made a critical shift to become an anti-racist and anti-oppression organization in the late 1990s after members and staff participated in a series of transformational Undoing Institutional Racism workshops. The shift included intensive staff, board, and youth trainings on organizational change, undoing institutional racism, and white privilege. This resulted in a deep and practiced commitment and accountability to the leadership of youth of color, low-income, young women, LGBTQ youth, and to shared principles of anti-racist and anti-oppression organizing. SYPP continues to practice this commitment throughout our infrastructure and personnel today: our projects, outreach strategies, hiring practices, and the social change we seek to prioritize the needs and experiences of youth living at the intersections of these identities and experiences. Because how often do marginalized youth receive or supported or valued with access and opportunities to build their own leadership that is youth centered and driven? To also build power, means to envision something different and something more liberatory than what we live in today. We're building on anti-racism and anti-oppression values towards envisioning: where do we want to go and what do we want to build! Which builds off of and moves us from survival and resistance to growth and thriving because we are inherently worth so much more.\r\n\r\nSYPP recognizes that young folks are often labeled and placed into assumed identities and roles without their consent. In response, we prioritize development of young people's abilities to define their futures for themselves by supporting their own growth, skills building and critical thinking. Our vision is to expand roles of youth within the social justice movement and to support the long-term growth of not only youth organizers but people committed to a lifetime of envisioning and building towards another world.\r\n\r\nSYPP is building a pipeline for youth in our community to become leaders in social justice movements that emotionally, intellectually, and financially sustains them to work as community organizers over a lifetime. We envision a more liberatory and life sustaining system(s) that no longer calculates future prison beds based on test scores but rather plans for the ever-growing number of youth leaders ready and committed to community organizing and social justice change. SYPP is directly contributing to this impact by supporting youth in ongoing and engaged leadership beyond short-term periods of community organizing and other fragmented opportunities for leadership such as summer volunteer work or community service required for school. Young folks engage in long-term meaningful ways on average for three to four years with SYPP.\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative1": "The mission of Latinos Unidos Siempre (L.U.S.) is to empower youth to take leadership roles in the community.  To accomplish this, we work towards the educational, cultural, social and political development of Latino (and all) youth.  We advocate for social and political change, while combating racist stereotypes and discrimination, through popular education and grassroots organizing.  \r\nL.U.S. was established in 1996, in Salem, Oregon.  A group of 13 students came together that year (under the coordination of Martha Calderon and Roberto Barraza) to fight against immigration raids, a high dropout rate, gang activity, and four anti-immigrant proposals in the State legislature.  L.U.S. quickly became the youth arm of Mano a Mano Family Center, our parent organization and fiscal sponsor, and also of the pro-immigrant rights movement in our area, as represented by the CAUSA immigrant rights coalition, and the Salem-Keizer Coalition for Equality.  \r\nOur first event ever was a Thanksgiving dinner for low income families, which continues to this day almost uninterrupted since 1996.  We have organized the Urban Art Fest promoting acceptance of urban youth culture in Salem, for five years now.  In 2010, we received recognition from Basic Rights Oregon (B.R.O.) for our work in support of the Uniting Communities project, bringing Latino and LGBT youth together.  \r\nSince 1996, more than 1,000 youth have been members or affiliates of L.U.S.  However, our biggest success has been serving as an incubator for new leaders in our movement.  For example, six alumni currently serve as staff of a CAPACES network organization, including the Executive Director of Mano a Mano.   ",

    "narrative3": "Many Latino youth in Salem-Keizer, Oregon, are disconnected from their families, their communities, and from themselves.  This is evident through problems such as high teen pregnancy rates, hunger, low college enrollments and disproportionate minority contacts (in the juvenile justice system).  \r\nThe roots of this disconnectedness are institutionalized racism, low expectations, and lack of adult support.  \r\nFor example, youth of color in Marion County are detained and charged at higher rates than White youth\u2013 even when accounting for all possible variables!  Youth who have low expectations of themselves, also have a poor view of their future.  They also feel that they have little control over their lives and over affecting change in the community.  Many of the same youth also don\u2019t feel they are valued by their parents, and their community, so they have little interest to making things better.  They give up control over their rights, their bodies, and their future, resulting in high teen pregnancy rates, low academic achievement, and increasing the risk for criminal behavior and generational poverty.    \r\nLUS first tries to create a safe, positive and welcoming environment for all youth, especially those who feel they are ignored by the community for being youth, for being LGBT, for the color of their skin, or for their immigrant status, national origin, language or for previous mistakes.  We mainly do this by bringing in positive young adults to serve as mentors, as friends, and even as cheerleaders \u2013 because we need to celebrate every one of our successes!  Adult allies then serve, formally or informally, to eliminate the idea that adults don\u2019t care about youth.   Lastly, we show the youth that they can have influence over themselves, their community, and their future.  We provide other youth like us with the tools to become leaders, and advocate for their rights.  Youth will build power from learning about the problems, how they are affected, developing and implementing solutions, and seeing the results of their own work.  \r\nBy showing institutions the power of organized youth, we hope to make institutions (such as the juvenile justice department, school districts, etc.) more responsive to our needs.  The resulting changes in policies and attitudes will create a community that is responsive to ALL of its members.    ",

    "narrative1": "This funding request represents a new partnership between Youngstown Cultural Arts Center, and Totem Star, a multimedia non-profit mentorship and education organization based in Seattle. Totem Star empowers youth with life skills through multimedia production and social justice education to increase civic engagement, leadership development, and community building. Since 2010, Totem Star has served over 100 youth through partnerships with the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration, Seattle Violence Prevention Initiative, and Neighborhood House.\r\n\r\nTotem Star was selected by the City of Seattle, the Office of Film + Music, and One Reel as a featured youth-serving organization at Bumbershoot 2012 \u201cin an effort to raise awareness on the positive impact they\u2019ve had on our music community.\u201d Totem Star youth share the stories of their intergenerational struggles on the newly-released mixtape Reality. Many of the original songs on the mixtape have been aired on KUBE 93 and KOMO Newsradio along with on-air interviews with the youth.\r\n\r\nThrough multimedia production and mentorship, Totem Star 1) provides a safe environment for artistic creation, expression, and learning; 2) reinforces positive decision-making skills amidst a bombardment of information on a massive scale; and 3) encourages youth to be active leaders in their community. With social justice education as a top priority, Totem Star challenges youth to imagine themselves in real-world situations where they may be victims of social injustice, and empowers them with information and knowledge to navigate these circumstances.\r\n\r\nYoungstown shares the same social justice objectives as Totem Star, and has a history of hosting innovative youth programming.  Youngstown Records, in partnership with MusicianCorps as part of Youngstown's groundbreaking ALL ACCESS Program, was similar to the project proposed herein and was highly successful in giving youth tools to raise their voices around the struggles and solutions in their lives.

    "narrative3": "The gap that Totem Star strives to fill is the lack of sustainable multimedia arts opportunities for youth of color in low-income communities. One of the root causes of this problem is mismanagement of the very little resources that are offered to community organizations that are already challenged by the microeconomic situation present in those low-income communities. The youth at the Southwest Interagency Academy, primarily youth of color from low-income families, will be directly involved in the leadership of the new partnership between Youngstown Cultural Arts Center and Totem Star to resurrect and rebuild a multimedia arts program at Youngstown. \r\n\r\nIn addition to upgrading the multimedia facilities (recording studio, live performance space, photo/video production suite, etc.), students will create multimedia works (music, video, photo galleries, etc.) with the aim of securing more funds to sustain programming through community awareness and fundraising events.  The works created by participating youth will address challenges these young people face, and will offer positive solutions to these problems that the participants come up with through dialogue in the program.  Participating youth will then learn how to maintain their own programming by using their works as tools to draw in sponsors, donors, and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis program will continue the Youngstown Cultural Arts Center's history of building collective power by leveraging the wealth of arts and youth leadership expertise already vibrant in the building, engaging leaders from Arts Corps, Nature Consortium, The Service Board, Youth Media Institute, and other organizations that call Youngstown home to share best practices and guide programming towards success.  Leaders from these partnering organizations, as well as the staff at Youngstown, Totem Star, and Southwest Interagency Academy, are ready to work together to support the students here.  The root cause of why many of the students at Southwest Interagency have enrolled there is a lack of support in their lives based on their circumstances that has led them to be unsuccessful in traditional schools.  Attacking this root cause by supplying these young people with educational and emotional support networks is one of the ties that binds the Youngstown stakeholders' integrative approach in supporting the Southwest Interagency youth in this program.",

This includes an upgrade to the recording studio, purchasing and/or procuring photo/video equipment, providing on-site training on proper equipment usage and care, and establishing a system of accessibility for youth revolving around strict guidelines and accountability.\r\n\r\nTotem Star will work with Youngstown Cultural Arts Center to outreach with Southwest Interagency Academy staff. Totem Star will lead the recruitment of students who display great aptitude towards the arts and strong leadership qualities to form a core student body (at least 3 paid youth organizer positions) that organizes the movement to re-establish a youth media arts community at Youngstown Cultural Arts Center. The goal of the movement is to strengthen Youngstown's role as a pillar of the West Seattle arts community, and expand the services we're able to offer young people.\r\n\r\nAssessment of program success will be done 1) Quantitatively, by tracking the number of student participants, program contact hours, equipment upgrades, and new works created; and 2) Qualitatively, by soliciting feedback from student participants about how well the program meets their needs and what can change to improve effectiveness going forward with the program.  Input from Southwest Interagency Academy staff will also be used to assess success and guide future programming.",

All of the prevention efforts of the coalition are targeting middle school youth at Aki Kurose Middle School Academy with the goal of increasing community connectedness and increasing pro-social opportunities among teachers, youth, and their parents to decrease policies, laws, and social norms favorable to drug and alcohol use in Southeast Seattle.\r\n\r\nYoungstown has formed a partnership with Southwest Youth and Family Services to take an active role in Seattle's Youth Violence Prevention Initiative, including among other things mitigating gang-related graffiti along Delridge and creating murals in place of unwanted graffiti.  This not only serves to dampen gang activity in the area, but also will provide Delridge with more beautification efforts and a stronger artistic and cultural identity through community input around mural content design.  Youngstown staff also work in constant partnership with local organizations committed to social justice around race, class, gender and sexual identity, and other issues that directly affect our community.  These partners include Youngstown tenant organizations Arts Corps, Nature Consortium, the Service Board, and others.",

This new partnership will target students at the Southwest Interagency Academy, who \"for any number of reasons, haven\u2019t been able to succeed in regular school settings.\"\r\n\r\nThrough open dialogue at each studio recording session, Totem Star intentionally initiates conversations with youth on topics that make connections between the interpersonal struggles they face in their lives and the many forms of oppression in the engineered capitalistic society that can only exist through corruption and exploitation of the masses: Microeconomics and how it can negatively affect the core of a family; Social engineering, subliminal messaging in mainstream media, and its adverse effect on marginalized communities, especially with respect to encouraging youth to engage in unhealthy risk factors, including micro-aggression, drug and alcohol abuse, youth violence, and refusal to open one's mind to the \"street code of silence;\" Homophobia and how we are trained by messaging in the mainstream media to be controlled by fear; Religion vs. science: indoctrinated faith in \"beliefs\" vs. building and organizing knowledge through testable prediction - and importantly, how religion was used to colonize and assimilate native peoples into the society and \"culture\" of imperialists.\r\n\r\nWith music production as the primary hook to engage youth and build trust, Totem Star strives to increase youth civic engagement, leadership development, and community building through a curriculum built on social justice education and social-emotional development.

    "narrative3": "Latino students are struggling to graduate from high school (57% graduated in 4-years in 2011, 52% for Limited English Proficiency students, and 70% for white students). There is a significant gap in standardized test scores between ELL, Latino and white students at every grade level.  For instance, on the 11th grade reading test 67% of Latino students met or exceeded expectations compared to 88% of white students; only 23% of Limited English Proficient students passed the test. In addition, \u201c[i]n Oregon\u2019s juvenile justice system\u2026children of color [including Latinos] were more likely to be (1) arrested than their white peers, (2) charged with delinquent acts, (3) removed from their family\u2019s care and custody, (4) remanded for trials as adults, (5) found guilty of delinquent acts, and (6) incarcerated\u201d (page 1 of ACLU's recent report, \u201cOregon\u2019s School-to-Prison Pipeline\u201d).\r\n\r\nThese inequities are caused by institutional racism and cultural barriers in many communities around Oregon, including cultural misunderstandings and stereotypes that exist and a sense of threat to existing White privilege, which has been carefully institutionalized over Oregon\u2019s history. Latino parents, especially immigrant parents, have limited power: limited formal education in Spanish (6th grade or lower), limited funds, limited English, and schools that differ culturally and might not be welcoming. The Salem community (school board, local government, and legislators) is governed almost exclusively by white, middle and upper class conservative decision makers who may be well-intentioned, but predominantly do not understand the institutionalized racism that exists in this community and throughout Oregon, stifling opportunity and real equality.\r\n\r\nOur solution to these issues is bottom up \u2013 Latino Family Empowerment \u2013 and top down \u2013 working to build power for communities of color at the state and community levels. The four legs of our strategy are advocacy, parent organizing, parent-led family literacy, and youth leadership development. We use Popular Education to empower Latino youth and non- or limited-English speaking, immigrant and non-immigrant, low-income Latino parents in Salem and around the state as advocates and, for parents, as their children\u2019s first teachers. From the bottom up, we support parents and young adults in building their knowledge, their voices, their confidence, and thus their power through our parent workshops, youth leadership development programs, and the actions they take in their homes, their schools, at school board meetings, and at the state legislative and policy levels, speaking up for their families and the needs of Latino children in schools, especially ELL children. From the top down, Executive Director Eduardo Angulo\u2019s work to advocate and educate at the local, state, and national levels, serving on taskforces, consistently attending statewide policy-making and legislative meetings, which equips parents and youth with the information they need to be effective decision-makers and advocates.

Given this, it was urgent to harness the power of the leaders of communities of color and English-language learners, bringing our voices together to speak as one, centralizing our power so we can effectively influence the system. Thus, the OAEE was born: to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in education and ensure that students of color and students learning English graduate prepared for success.  SKCE helped found OAEE and now helps shape the agenda and our Latino families and youth bring their power to bear through this coalition. Because of OAEE, communities of color have a voice at the table where decisions are made, and can increase our sophistication as we work to improve opportunities for ELL and students of color throughout Oregon.\r\n\r\nThe CAPACES network exists so that like-minded Latino organizations in the Salem/Keizer and Woodburn areas can coordinate to strengthen the Movement overall. We each do different work, but we all work to support low-income immigrant Latinos, and the network enabled us to come together to help pass historic legislation this year (tuition-equity and driver-cards) and will allow coordination if and when National Comprehensive Immigration Reform is passed. SKCE is a member of this collaboration, and is the only one specifically focused on education advocacy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, SKCE works with the Micronesian and Pacific Islander Community and the local branch of the NAACP leadership and membership in Salem and Keizer. We unite to speak for ELL children and students of color within Salem, supporting one another to move towards policy that will support any or all of the children we represent.", 
    "narrative6": "As shown by our partnerships, racial justice is a significant focus of our work, both at the state and at the local levels. The OAEE\u2019s priorities are for racial justice in education and destroying the school-to-prison pipeline that is deeply harming youth of color. The CAPACES network is focused on racial justice for Latinos, and we work in collaboration and partnership with other communities of color groups in Salem. Additionally, SKCE has taken a public stance in support of justice for our lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered sisters and brothers. The Movement values this so deeply that public support is a requirement for involvement in the CAPACES network. One of the CAPACES network members, CAUSA, works specifically for LGBTQ justice with the support of all these sister organizations and we see this as one of the most important values of the Movement: to confront any discrimination. Our executive director is personally, deeply committed to this issue, and saw his mother\u2019s example standing up against homophobia in their low-income community some 40 years ago. For three years, we held trainings offered by Western State Center on these issues for our staff and parent facilitators, deconstructing the homophobia that is very present in low-income, Catholic-rooted Latino families. We are similarly committed to issues of economic injustice, which are ever-present for our low income families. This is part of why it is so critical to us to share our physical space with Mano a Mano, who provides direct services such as food boxes, referral services, citizenship and computer classes and more, all of which elevate people to self-sufficiency to combat economic injustices. On the level of what can be done \u201cnow,\u201d we also contract with members of many families, all while working for a future where Latino children are educated and increasingly able to go forth and make money to reinvest in this community and changing these economic injustices. Without developing leaders who are educated and empowered to advocate, we cannot break the cycle of injustice and oppression.",

    "cycle_question": "Moises Mendoza joined the Mock Trial team because of his encounter with the inequity of the justice system for monolingual Spanish-speakers when he was a child of about five years old. When his father was pulled over, he worked hard to interpret for his father with the policeman, but he was not heard. In the courtroom, he was overwhelmed by the technical jargon and the judge ignored him. His voice was denied, and he was unable to help his father. \r\n\r\nBecause of these cultural and linguistic barriers, monolingual parents of Latino youth are similarly unable to help their children, leading to tragic results. Statistics show one in six Latino men will be imprisoned in their lifetime, Latino youth are more than twice as likely as White youth to have cases transferred to adult court, and, when indicted for a Measure 11 crime, Latino youth are more likely than Black or White youth to be found guilty of it.\r\n\r\nMoises\u2019 experience created his interest in law and distrust of law enforcement, which led him to join the Mock Trial and debate team. The other Latina/o youth on the team, who all come from immigrant backgrounds, also developed an interest in and distrust of law, and through the team these youth are finding their confidence, voices, and a belief that the law can help protect their community. Over the next year, the youth of the Mock Trial team can use their voices to speak out to the legislature, local school board, and others, working to change a flawed system so that youth of color (Latino and other) cease to be overrepresented in the criminal justice system. Through the OAEE\u2019s work and other opportunities with the Coalition\u2019s existing campaigns, these youth will have specific opportunities to wield their newfound power and their voices.",

In November 2005, OPAL (Organizing People, Activating Leaders) participated in the 2005 National Brownfield Conference in Denver, CO around \u201cDiverse Community Stakeholder Involvement in Environmental Justice Communities\u201d, and from there decided to work with the City of Portland Brownfield Program and organize a Steering Committee for a Groundwork Portland trust focused on a \u201cCommunity-First\u201d approach revitalization of community spaces.  The Steering Committee performed a gap analysis, feasibility study in Spring 2007 that determined a need for an organization focused on building relationships with traditionally ignored communities to increase environmental justice by increasing opportunities to influence neighborhood development and converting vacant, contaminated lots into green space, community gardens and parks.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, Groundwork Portland has organized hundreds of low-income and minority community members (students of all ages, elders, residents, and families) to cleanup and design a lead-contaminated property and convert it into a community garden and outdoor learning center. Community members continue to maintain and take ownership of the garden and learning center.  \r\n\r\nGroundwork Portland has engaged over 60 diverse young adults through its Green Teams and now a Youth Action Board, who learn about environmental and social justice issues, brownfields redevelopment, through hands on activities and leadership development. \r\n\r\nGroundwork Portland formed the Portland Harbor Community Coalition, that includes Native, Latino, Eastern European, Iraqi, and Asian, anti-poverty and educational groups and individuals with the goal to raise the voices of Environmental Justice communities, ensuring these communities are able to influence the final outcome of the Portland Harbor Superfund cleanup process on the Willamette River.

    "narrative3": "Groundwork Portland's work addresses the need for communities to have access to clean water, food (including river fish and lamprey) and clean land.  There are serious health risks from existing contamination in the lower Willamette River, as documented by public health assessments conducted throughout the Portland Harbor Superfund site,  and the existing fish consumption advisory which recommends that women ages 18-45 and children under 6 not consume any resident fish from the Harbor.  \r\n\r\nEast Portland is comprised of 13 neighborhoods divided from the rest of Portland by the I-205 highway, and six adjacent neighborhoods just west of I-205.  Much of East Portland was urbanized after World War II, designed for the automobile and disconnected by the construction of the highway.\r\n\r\nEast Portland lacks many of the qualities that Portland prides itself on: walkability, accessible amenities, dense mixed-use development, robust infrastructure, parks, and open space.  Additionally, it is home to some of the fastest growing, most diverse neighborhoods in the city, and this growth is marked by a concentration of poverty.  During the 2010-2011 school year, 78.5% of students in the David Douglas School District in East Portland were eligible for free and reduced lunch.  Eligibility was as high as 90.8% at David Douglas\u2019 Mill Park Elementary School.  David Douglas School District reports that 24% of students are English Language Learners, and 67 different languages are spoken by its students.\r\n\r\nThe lack of equitable development and planning is one underlying cause. Another is the historical lack of state and federal monitoring and regulation of contaminants and pollutants caused by businesses and government has led to many of the environmental justice problems described above that disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color in these areas of Portland today.  There is also limited state capacity to regulate existing pollutants being emitted into the air and water today.\r\n\r\nGroundwork Portland increases awareness for environmental justice communities about the power imbalances between industry, the real estate market, government and affected communities, and how to change that dynamic by participating in decision-making. The organization conducts project-specific trainings and dialogues for volunteers to learn how to collectively determine and implement community priorities for brownfields redevelopment and superfund cleanup. Groundwork Portland also collects stories of affected communities to share with Groundwork's base and target decision-makers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As a program of the YWCA Seattle | King | Snohomish, BABES helps drive the YWCA\u2019s mission to advance the quality of life for women of all ages, races and faiths, and their families.  \r\n\r\nBABES Network began with a diverse group of 13 women with HIV who met in one woman\u2019s home in 1989. These women gathered together to find peer support, something which they weren\u2019t finding at other support groups. They discovered that the issues they faced \u2013 such as domestic violence, fear of losing custody of our kids, the need for childcare, medical care by providers who understood women\u2019s needs \u2013 were not being addressed a system designed with upper-middle income white men in mind.  As the numbers grew, BABES found that more and more women spoke of their frustration with and alienation from the care service system, they felt empowered to create our own organization of support, advocacy, outreach and education for women with HIV. \r\n\r\nToday, BABES is the only program primarily serving the unique needs of women living with HIV in the Northwest. The program has grown from the kitchen table to one that not only provides case management, referrals and one-to-one support to BABES but it also builds connectedness and advocates for HIV prevention and resources. We strengthen the voice and build the leadership skills of each woman we serve to advocate for HIV positive women in our community. Going one step further, BABES fosters the confidence for needed services and social change.",

    "narrative3": "For a woman living with HIV, the daily struggle for health and stability can seem insurmountable. In addition to managing complicated medication regimens and appointments with multiple providers, the BABES Network clients also face the additional barriers of poverty, discrimination, cultural stigma and lack of health care access. Women are also often the providers and caregivers for their families, prioritizing the needs of their children before their own. \r\n\r\nBABES recognizes that social determinants, including a person\u2019s environment or economic status, can increase the difficulty for living healthy lives. Many societal systems and institutions have been designed to keep certain groups of people \u2013 such as people of color, people with low incomes, women, children and youth \u2013 disconnected and disenfranchised. In addition, HIV/AIDS services for men who have sex with men receive significantly more public funding and are more widely available than services targeting HIV/AIDS positive women. These systems have created a community with a legacy of inequity where the privileged benefit while others are marginalized.\r\n\r\nBABES Network  often exists as the only place for a positive woman to find the support, resources and voice she needs to build a stable and healthy life. Staff Peer Advocates and Peer Volunteers have similar experiences to the women they are supporting, and thus are well-positioned to address the multiple interconnected needs HIV positive women face. BABES addresses the lack of support, resources and leadership opportunities for the most marginalized women living with HIV in our community. \r\n\r\nOur staff Peer Advocates and Peer Volunteers empower BABES members and their families to fight for critical services to prevent HIV the transmission and provide support for people living with HIV/AIDS.   \r\nWe educate and train members in HIV awareness, leadership and advocacy, and connect them with opportunities to practice leadership. Our vision is that positive women will achieve leadership positions in the community to truly influence decisions that affect them and their families.\r\n\r\nOne way we leverage the strength of the BABES sisterhood is through the Our Leadership Circle \u2013 trainings, mentorship and volunteer opportunities to strengthen BABES members\u2019 leadership skills. This project takes our sisterhood to another level, where members learn how to use their HIV diagnosis as a source of strength, empowerment and grace. Our six strong, active Peer Volunteer leaders facilitate support groups, help with events and retreats, and lead workshops with staff.  These new leaders act as peer supports for other women living with HIV, and are a voice for all positive women. ",

We use a comprehensive approach as the best model to help those living with HIV continue living healthy, productive lives and prevent transmission of HIV. BABES plays a vital role in the continuum, through peer outreach that connects women with care providers, keeps them adherent to medications and offers a community of support. We will continue leadership development through our Leadership Circle and participate in community advocacy to ensure that the voices of our members are heard. As our network of leaders grows, we will expand our capacity to reach to more than 250 positive women and their affected family members in the Puget Sound region.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, we are serving a growing number of positive women from African countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Mali. A new peer-led African Born Social Gathering seeks to break down the stigma and shame that represent significant barriers for these BABES members.\r\n\r\nAnother priority is preparing members for Medicaid Expansion. Helping BABES members navigate the new care system will be a priority, as well as preparing members to advocate for themselves when these changes do occur \u2013 whether in the doctor\u2019s office or by reaching out to decision makers in Seattle and Olympia. \r\n\r\nBABES Network conducts evaluation of our program objectives on an on-going basis. We use qualitative and quantitative evaluation tools to collect data. As a program of the YWCA, our program data is entered and analyzed by the YWCA\u2019s Client Data team. Evaluation results are shared internally and externally to ensure we are meeting the needs of our members, improving program practices and also advocating for the services BABES members need.  ",

WHACAN is dedicated to advocating for public policies that protect and expand access to HIV treatment and prevention services. One way that BABES participates in WHACAN initiatives is through AIDS Action and Awareness Day in Olympia, WA. In March 2013, BABES staff, volunteers, and members traveled to Olympia to advocate for services critical to the health and stability of people living with HIV/AIDS. We continue to partner with other organizations and individuals to advocate for people affected by HIV in our region.\r\n\r\nBABES Peer Advocate Brenda Higgins participates in the Washington State Department of Health Community Programs Planning Group. This group functions to review and recommend guidelines and operational policies of the HIV client services Ryan White Part B community programs. Our participation in this group lends a consumer perspective and provides input addressing the impact of guidelines and policies on people living with HIV/AIDS. This network links agencies and groups providing HIV services to better coordinate HIV care and prevention activities.\r\n\r\nTo reach our goal of creating community and leadership opportunities for HIV positive women, we partner with a wide variety of local partners in addition to the two detailed above. To conduct outreach, education, and enrollment in health care services, we partner with communities of faith, homeless and domestic violence shelters, local businesses, health education organizations and local clinics.

BABES does not turn anyone away for services. We welcome anyone who identifies as a woman, as well as some men, into the BABES sisterhood. \r\n\r\nIn collaboration with People of Color Against AIDS Network, we host educational dinners.  In collaboration with African American Reach & Teach Health (AARTH) Ministries, we participate in and support their annual conference on HIV and Women of Color. In April 2013, BABES received an award from AARTH as a leading organization providing a link in HIV care in our community. In collaboration with the Gay City Health Project, we provide HIV outreach, education, and testing at events.

    "cycle_question": "We know that people living with HIV in the criminal justice system represent a relatively small portion of the inmate population. However, the ACLU reports that people with HIV/AIDS are disproportionately imprisoned.  While incarcerated, it can be hard to get needed medications and corrections facility staff may not have an adequate understanding of HIV or the importance of treatment adherence to maintain a patient\u2019s health. According to The AIDS Institute, inmates, particularly women, are afflicted with a concentration of the epidemics that face the general population. The concentration of diseases, sexually transmitted infections, mental disorders, and HIV/AIDS is exponentially higher among inmates and the highest among incarcerated women. While women are not a majority of the inmate population, their population is affected by these issues at staggering rates \u2013 and these women are at increased risk due to the lack of resources consistently and uniformly available to them.\r\n\r\nSome of our BABES Peer Advocates have been formerly incarcerated and have the experience that helps them relate to women currently or recently incarcerated. We are well positioned to help women empower themselves to make positive choices for themselves to engage in medical care and stay out of incarceration.\r\n\r\nWe also provide a crucial support to incarcerated HIV positive women as they transition from prison back into their communities. BABES Network connects these women to resources for their wide array of needs, including support services beyond HIV treatment. Providing a link to services for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women provides them the resources and support they need to reduce the likelihood of recidivism and maintain healthy lives.",

We are one of the few organizations in the country that serves Asian, South Asian, and Pacific Islander community members, survivors, and their families. \r\n\r\nBoth agencies were founded in the mid-1990s, to provide services to Asian survivors \u2013 nearly all of whom are immigrants and refugees. We have long supported one another and shared expertise and resources. The Safety Center brings a long history of work in domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking. It has served the broader Asian and Pacific Islander (API) communities, and is nationally known for its Natural Helper community organizing model. Chaya has supported survivors and families from South Asia, and has a strong track record engaging communities to change societal conditions that enable oppression. Our many accomplishments include: in 2000, helping to pass the nation\u2019s first statewide anti-trafficking law; continuing to successfully partner with South Asian imams and other Muslim leaders in delivering services and improving policies to support survivors through the Peaceful Families Task force. In 2012, we fielded 3,250 helpline calls, and provided on-going advocacy support to 256 survivors through our direct service program, and engaged thousands more through our community education and outreach programs.

    "narrative3": "API survivors experiencing domestic and sexual violence face significant and multiple barriers that leave them vulnerable and unsafe. Lack of knowledge about domestic and sexual violence coupled with immigration concerns, religious beliefs, family pressures and more can result in API victims becoming trapped in unsafe relationships. When survivors do seek help or confront abusers, they risk losing ties with support networks, family and community. Because immigrant communities are often small and tightly knit, it can be very difficult for these women to re-establish the supportive systems to heal and rebuild lives.\r\n\r\nWhile domestic violence and sexual assault have always existed in API communities, the topic is considered taboo and not discussed. In many Asian cultures, women are still considered property of men, evidenced by dowries and arranged marriages. There is the belief that females who are raped are either \u201cdamaged goods\u201d or should marry their assailants. Stigma attached to public humiliation functions as a powerful tool to prevent families and communities from discussing \u201cpersonal\u201d problems, which prevents victims, and their families, from getting support and assistance. As a result, API immigrants, refugees and youth are vulnerable to becoming victims, and are at increased risk for emotional and psychological distress, physical injuries and death. This is further complicated by the fact that, while API cultures do not approve of domestic violence and sexual assault, most blame the victim or deny the abuse. Lack of understanding about the nature of this violence, information on resources and knowledge about legal protections for survivors keeps victims isolated and vulnerable.\r\n\r\nOur programs are designed to support people\u2019s empowerment and self-determination. We use a client-centered, culturally- and linguistically-relevant advocacy and support program model. Our staff and Natural Helpers represent the languages and cultures of our clients to make our services truly accessible. Core to our work is our Natural Helpers Program, a grassroots model where volunteers are trained to be community-based bridges to our services. While trained advocates play a key role in survivor support, this program allows for clients to receive additional support through the assistance of a trained bilingual/bicultural Natural Helper volunteer. Many clients welcome this option for added emotional and general support in coming out about an issue they feel cannot be expressed to family or friends, but which are de-stigmatized by community support. We reach out and work with API community partners and allies to find and train Natural Helpers. Because they come from within the community, they are well suited to intervene when needed and to be a supportive resource for survivors, helping them access our services. \r\n",

Our mission is to racially and ethnically diversify the U.S. environmental movement by developing leaders, diversifying institutions, and building community. By serving as an advocate, strategist, convener, connector, and educator for equity, diversity, and inclusion issues in the environmental movement, CDE is building a base of leaders and institutions representing a broad cross-section of environmental issues that are dedicated to a racially just movement. CDE has directly served over 1200 individuals and worked with over 16 organizations on change processes.  CDE is sparking a paradigm shift that is working towards its vision of creating a society where environmentalism and equity are inextricably linked, as evidenced by typical response from a leadership program participant:\r\n\r\n\u201c[The program] has been a life changing experience\u2026 I have learned that an equity lens, once graced with it, is the only way to view everything. all the time. in all that we do.\u201d \r\n\r\nCDE started the Environmental Professionals of Color (EPOC) in 2005 to bring together people of color working on environmental issues in the Portland area.  The network has grown to over 215 members in both Portland and Seattle. In 2008, CDE officially integrated EPOC into its programs, obtained a fiscal sponsor, and initiated programs, such as our equity forums, leadership development programs, and organizational equity work. In 2012, we started EPOC Seattle. \r\n\r\n(We use the term \u201cdiversity\u201d in our name and language when talking to mainstream environmental groups because it is an approachable term that can open up conversations to achieving our ultimate goal of dismantling institutional racism.)\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Institutional racism is the root cause of many problems and issues in the environmental movement, including (to name a few):\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe lack of people of color working for mainstream environmental groups.  Only 4-11% of staff and boards of mainstream environmental organizations are people of color (sources: Oregonian, Natural Resources Council of America, and Training Resources for the Environmental Community).  In comparison, Portland and Seattle are 28% and 34% people of color, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and growing.  On a national level, the U.S. is 36% people of color and will grow to 50% people of color by 2043.  Children in the U.S. will be over 50% people of color by 2019 according to the Brookings Institute.\r\n\u2022\tOver-representation of white men at top levels of environmental institutions and in important decision-making roles.\r\n\u2022\t Over a dozen polls since 2003 demonstrate the people of color are concerned about and support environmental issues at higher rates than whites yet people of color are ignored and not significantly integrated into environmental work and approaches.  For example, a 2010 The Nature Conservancy poll showed that voters of color are concerned about global warming, pollution and habitat loss at 14-22 percentage points higher than whites and more willing to pay for solutions.  \r\n\u2022\tMany people of color describe their experience working for environmental groups as isolating, oppressive, demoralizing, \u201ca lack of voice,\u201d and \u201ca lack of hope.\u201d\r\n\u2022\tLack of funding going towards people of color led organizations and efforts.\r\n\u2022\tLack of attention towards the innovation coming from people of color led environmental efforts.\r\n\r\nCDE builds collective power for creating a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive environmental movement by organizing people of color and white allies in the environmental movement. We achieve this collective power by working on the individual, organizational, and movement-wide levels through our programs (i.e., leadership development, organizational change work, and movement/community building activities). \r\n\r\nSpecifically in the EPOC network we implement our theory of change:\r\n\u2022\tAt the individual level we provide opportunities for individual change, empowerment, and leadership and create venues for interpersonal relationships to develop\r\n\u2022\tAt the organizational level, we develop and connect change agents who work within and outside mainstream environmental institutions that need to be more diversity, equitable, and inclusive.  In essence, EPOC members work within mainstream environmental institutions can provide the internal pressure for change, while members working outside mainstream environmental and sustainability institutions can provide the external pressure for change. \r\n\u2022\tAt the movement level, the EPOC network builds its own community and a stronger voice, while creating more impactful change on a movement level. Lastly, as a community, each EPOC chapter co-creates action-based solutions.\r\n",

    "narrative4": "Institutional and structural racism directly affects people of color who are committed to environmentalism, which is the reason CDE created the Environmental Professionals of Color (EPOC). Many EPOC members are the only or one of the few people of color at their environmental institutions.  The network provides members opportunities to organize, strategize, and coalesce around actions to overcome the oppressive challenges they face in the environmental movement.  Many describe their experience working for environmental groups as isolating, oppressive, demoralizing, \u201ca lack of voice,\u201d and \u201ca lack of hope.\u201d Unfortunately, environmental groups and the movement overall often loses the best and brightest pool of talent because of this homogeneous culture.  EPOC provides the support to keep and retain people of color and at times has re-engaged people of color who have left the environmental movement.\r\n\r\nProject Goals\r\n\r\n1) EPOC chapters in Portland and Seattle will be firmly established and will begin to implement strategic actions that will allow members to survive, thrive, lead, and innovate and ultimately create a stronger environmental movement.\r\n\r\n2) People of color in the environmental movement will be more connected and unified, which will empower them to survive, thrive, lead, and innovate. CDE will grow, support, develop and strengthen people of color leadership in the environmental movement through EPOC and CDE's other programs.\r\n\r\nSuccess will be measured if we achieve the following outcomes: \r\n\u2022\tImplement and explore opportunities identified by the chapter strategic plans (EPOC Seattle\u2019s strategy is expected by Fall 2013. EPOC Portland will develop a strategy through this project.)\r\n\u2022\tProvide training opportunities to deepen understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion \r\n\u2022\tGrow the community (EPOC Seattle). EPOC Seattle is fairly new (started in May 2012), and there is room to increase the number of members.\r\n\u2022\tDevelop a strategy (EPOC Portland)\r\n\u2022\tHost regular networking events", 
    "narrative5": "Environmental Professionals of Color (EPOC) \r\nCDE organizes the Environmental Professionals of Color network by and for leaders of color, many of whom are the only person or one of the few people of color working at their environmental institutions. The purpose of this network is to provide a safe space for connecting people of color to catalyze change by surviving, thriving, innovating, and leading in environmentalism. They fill a unique and valuable role as bridges between the environmental community and communities of color.\r\n\r\nEnvironment 2042 Leadership Program Alumni- A network of about 40 environmental leaders and change agents who have a shared experience of attending CDE's Environment 2042 Leadership Program.  Alumni (people of color and white allies) continue to lead change in their spheres of influence and look to the network for support, guidance, and direction.  CDE created and continues to cultivate this growing community of change agents.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "The reason CDE was created in 2008 was to address institutional racism in the environmental movement.  In all of our programs, diversity, equity, and inclusion in all its forms is valued and integrated.  While we have a focus on racial equity, other equity issues, including gender, socio-economic, and sexual orientation equity are integrated into our work.  In addition, of the over 1200 individuals we have worked with over the years, about 50-60% are white people.  We are developing and cultivating white allies while empowering and strengthening people of color leadership.  In addition, we are the only organization that is creating designated space for white allies and people of color to discuss institutional racism and other inequities and solutions to these challenges.  Environmental professionals and organizations continue to seek our leadership.  \r\n\r\nLastly, we do not describe our work as environmental justice, which is why we did not apply to the SJF's Environment Justice program.  While we overlap with environmental justice principles (such as developing people of color leadership) and include environmental justice leaders and groups in our network, we committed to (at our founding) that we would not compete for environmental justice funding.  That funding is limited and needs to go toward groups that are working in communities of color.   Environmental justice is an important component to our work and people of color's interest in environmental work and equity work is broadly complex and robust and overlays with all forms of environmental work.",

Our mission is to unite diverse institutions to strengthen leadership and organizational capacity, and to build collective civil sector power that counters the dominance of market forces and facilitates the full participation of citizens in civic life. \r\n\r\nMACG operated as a 501c3 from its founding in 2002 to August 2011 when it changed its name to MACG Vision and moved some of its operations and former name (MACG) to a 501c4. This action was part of a strategy to address the demographic changes in member institutions as the result of urban gentrification, and to ensure that a majority of the MACG Vision board is made up of low-income individuals directly affected by the issues addressed.  MACG Vision exists to develop leaders capable of acting in the public arena on issues impacting low income, minority and other marginalized communities. \r\n\r\nIn January 2013 MACG Vision held a two-day Spanish Leadership Institute, attended by 37 Latinos from member institution St. Andrew Catholic Church.  Four bi-lingual, bi-cultural Latino leaders worked with MACG\u2019s lead organizer to make culturally appropriate adaptations to the training, and then conducted the training themselves.  Trained leaders immediately began working on the successful passage of a legislative bill to restore driving privileges for undocumented immigrants.  \r\n\r\nIn response to a critical shortage of permanent housing for women and children survivors of domestic violence, leaders worked with member institution, Recovery Association Project, to adapt the Oxford House model of democratic self-sustaining housing for people in recovery to the domestic violence survivor population.

    "narrative3": "MACG works on fair sentencing prior to incarceration, pay equity for work done in prison, and housing and employment discrimination following release.  The causes of these are: unfair sentencing laws that remove judicial discretion; lack of effective programming and skill-building in prison; and limited opportunities for ex-prisoners to find living wage jobs due to widespread discrimination.\r\n\r\nMACG builds collective power by fostering relationships among leaders of our diverse member organizations.  Leaders share personal stories, identify common threads and act together for change.  A challenge we\u2019ve experienced in working with people coming out of prison is that member institution PHOENIX RISING Transitions has had trouble retaining members long enough after prison (averaging six months in PHOENIX\u2019s mentor project) to move into MACG leadership roles.   To help address this issue, in August 2012, with MACG\u2019s assistance, PHOENIX opened a transition house designed to be different from other reentry and clean and sober housing options.  The aim was to foster the \u201cculture of relational power\u201d that PHOENIX and MACG develop through community organizing.  We are already seeing the results.  \r\n\r\nIn February, four PHOENIX members, including three house residents graduated from MACG\u2019s 12-hour leadership training.   A fifth member served as a table leader.   In April, two more members completed the training.  \r\n\r\nLiving together has created a stronger bond among residents, and a stronger investment in community organizing. The Core (leadership) Team is centered at the house.  Holding regular meetings there has increased the involvement of non-resident members, as well as those living in the house, and provides the support and encouragement for members to take on more challenging leadership roles. \r\n\r\nIn April, two house residents testified before the Oregon legislature\u2019s Public Safety Committee regarding a sentencing reform bill.  On Lobby Day at the state Capitol in May, three house residents and two other PHOENIX members were part of a group of 75 leaders visiting legislators. They were the key storytellers sharing first-hand experience about the need for sentencing reform. They received high praise from other participants for their level of preparation and the crucial role they played in Lobby Day. \r\n\r\nThe recent training and legislative advocacy experience has engaged PHOENIX members and we want to keep the momentum going by planning a local campaign to provide the opportunity for PHOENIX members and other MACG leaders to practice the tools of community organizing.  The \u201cBan the Box\u201d campaign is a primary focus of our Social Justice Fund criminal justice proposal.  The campaign will be to eliminate the prior conviction checkbox on all City of Portland employment applications, to help break the severe employment discrimination faced by formerly incarcerated individuals who are trying to turn their lives around.

    "narrative5": "We began organizing within the Latino community in January 2013, and developed relationships with new allies around collective advocacy for restoration of driving privileges for undocumented immigrants.  Our collaboration in that effort included  work with Oregon DREAMers, VOZ, Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice (IMIrJ), American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), and Jobs with Justice.  While our purpose initially was around driver\u2019s license restoration, we will continue to establish strong partnerships with these and other organizations focused on immigrant justice issues.  Because MACG makes change through community organizing, our role in our recent (first) collaboration was to engage our members to participate in a variety of activities, including a \u201cComing out of the Shadows\u201d rally at the state Capitol, education forums on the legislation, videotaped stories, etc. \r\n\r\nIn our work with formerly incarcerated individuals, we worked most closely with Partnership for Safety and Justice.  We took guidance from PSJ on overall messaging and specific talking points with both community members and legislators.  PSJ staff members spoke at two of our Prison & Community Action Team meetings, and we, in turn, shared feedback with PSJ from legislators on sentencing reform legislation that we gathered during our Lobby Day visits. MACG\u2019s role was to turn out people for advocacy efforts, and to spread the word on issues via our email network to members of our 22 member institutions.\r\n\r\nWe expect our collaborations to cross issue and constituency lines because low-income people and minority populations are affected by a variety of equity issues.  We base collaborations on strong relationships, using relational (one-to-one) meetings as the foundational practice.  This prepares us to move to other issue work when one campaign ends, rather than having to start from the beginning, leading to a broad, unified, effective, and sustained progressive movement. ", 
    "narrative6": "The two areas that MACG is currently focusing on:  immigrant justice and justice for people coming out of prison align with other racial justice and social justice movements because they address conditions that promote the economic inequities that disproportionately impact all low-income, minority and marginalized populations.  Working for immigration justice provides the opportunity to bring to light disparities in employment, education, health care, housing and other areas that especially affect minority populations, families experiencing generational poverty, and other marginalized populations, including formerly incarcerated men and women.   Working with ex-prisoners has revealed how this population is especially stigmatized and frustrated in their attempts to stay out of prison due especially to discrimination in housing and employment.\r\n\r\nMACG is primarily a white-led organization.  However, our commitment to work with the Latino population is an intentional step toward  racial diversification of our member base, and working to more fully engage MACG members who have been incarcerated brings to light the widespread discrimination against this population, as well.  Both communities are directly affected by social injustice.   We continue to work to diversify the MACG Vision board, which is made up of a majority of low-income people, including two members of minority populations.  We are intentionally working to develop members of PHOENIX in leadership opportunities that will prepare them to join the board \u2013 a key goal for the coming year.  Of the men we\u2019re working with, one is African-American and another is Native American.  \r\n\r\nFor the current Oregon legislative session, MACG formally endorsed the Oregon Health Equity Alliance (OHEA) agenda, and included all five of their priority issues in our own advocacy efforts.  OHEA is comprised of six organizations led by people of color:  Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon (APANO), Oregon Latino Health Coalition, Oregon Action, Center for Intercultural Organizing, Urban League of Portland, and Causa Oregon.  As part of our Latino organizing we worked with the Oregon Latino Health Coalition to support pre-natal health care for all women, and cultural competency training for health professionals \u2013 two priority issues for the Coalition.  As stated above, we worked in partnership with several immigrant justice organizations for the successful passage of legislation to reinstate driving privileges for undocumented immigrants. ",

    "narrative1": "The Incarcerated Mothers Advocacy Project (IMAP) seeks to change the rights afforded incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women in Washington State. In August 2010, IMAP was founded by women of color law students and their allies as a reproductive justice and prison abolition response to the over-incarceration of women and girls. The reproductive justice (RJ) framework recognizes that control and exploitation of gender, sexuality and reproduction is an effective strategy of controlling women and communities, particularly communities of color. In following this framework, we sought a model grounded in organizing individuals to change structural power inequalities with leadership by those directly affected. As prison abolitionists, we sought an end to viewing incarceration as the preferred form of punishment. Many of our founding members had family members/friends impacted directly by the criminal justice system or the war on drugs. Working with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated mothers, we saw that our current child welfare and criminal justice systems rarely leave individuals feeling empowered and supported. We saw few opportunities or acknowledgement of the ability of incarcerated or formerly incarcerated individuals to effect systemic change. We wanted a social change organization, not a mere social services organization. To that end, we designed a program to get incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals together, connect people in similar situations, and allow individuals to work together for change. \r\n\r\nSince Spring of 2011, we provide legal education, know your rights workshops, relationship skills courses, peer to peer mentorship, and poetry writing workshops at our state women\u2019s prisons. We also provide legal information and resources to several re-entry locations. We successfully helped organize incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women to better inform SHB 1284 (Children of Incarcerated Parents Bill) and provide personal stories to secure its passage. SHB 1284 was signed into law May 8th 2013.\r\n",

IMAP seeks to provide legal education and information to help prevent the separation of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated mothers from their children. We believe that the incarceration of women, and further, the separation of incarcerated mothers from their children due to incarceration, is a form of violence and reproductive oppression. We envision a day in which women of every color, ability, class and sexual orientation are able to help shape the policies that affect them and their families.  In such a world, the rights of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women as persons and mothers would not only be respected but also supported. ",

    "narrative3": "From 1995 to 2005, the number of women in prison in Washington State increased 84 percent. Most of these women are mothers, and over half have children under the age of 18. Less than a third of these children are in the care of the other parent; most live with relatives or end up in the foster care system. Many are children of color, because of well-documented racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Although most women serve short sentences, incarceration can mean the permanent loss of the parent/child relationship.  This loss harms families and communities, and could be avoided by alternatives to confinement, better child welfare policies, and access to legal information.\r\n\r\nThe change needed is to engage women in the systems that affect them: First, lawyers and the law will not alone change the system\u2014women need to be given the information necessary to advocate on behalf of themselves to ensure that our child welfare and family law court systems give them real opportunities to maintain their parental relationships. Second, it is critical that incarcerated women help develop strategies for systemic change. \r\n\r\nIMAP is the only sustainable program in Washington dedicated to preserving incarcerated mothers' parental rights. Little attention has been paid to the effects drug policy has on women and girls. We seek to change this by bringing women together in order to build collective power to negotiate with, and hold accountable, the systems infringing on their parental rights. To that end, we provide legal information and resources to demystify the legal system for individuals representing themselves. Our Q&A sessions provide legal information and resources and serve as an opportunity to bring women together to share their own knowledge and teach one another. Our poetry and relationship skills classes also connect individuals in the same situation. Our legal library office hours sessions nurture and develop leadership skills. We work directly with the inmate legal library clerks to help women draft letters to attorneys and social workers to create a legal system that is responsive to their needs. We actively engage women in the political process: how a bill becomes a law, how to take part in the political process, and how to use personal stories to effect change. Our poetry workshops and advocacy help connect women to information and space to discuss how the larger social, political and economic systems work to their disadvantage. \r\n\r\nBy engaging incarcerated women in the legal and legislative process, our work seeks to counter the stigma of incarceration and substance abuse. We aim to challenge the devaluation of motherhood for incarcerated women and reduce the chances of family separation.",

Worth is an advocacy and consulting group comprised of currently and formerly incarcerated women who will train our formerly incarcerated and currently incarcerated parents with the goal to create a policy initiative or directive that comes from the women themselves. The trainings will include looking at the larger social, political and economic systems that work to their disadvantage and coming up with effective solutions.\r\n\r\nEvaluation\r\nWe will develop a mechanism for women to provide anonymous feedback for the programming and allow for changes in programming to be made accordingly. We will track the number of women attending our training, their ability to change communication with their social worker and/or attorney, ability to affect the outcome of their custody situation, and whether they felt supported even where the legal outcome was not what they had wished. We will also track women who would like to continue engaging in social change work once they are outside of the prison. If we are able to identify and push a policy position, change will be evident.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "We currently work with the Washington State Parents Advocacy Committee and the King County Parent Advocacy Committee (KCPAC).  KCPAC is co-lead by Kimberly Mays, who experienced the separation from her children due to incarceration. The committee brings together veteran parents and staff to improve child welfare outcomes through education and advocacy with and on behalf of parents entering and/or involved with the child welfare system.  \r\n\t\r\nIn addition, we work with Surge NW formerly the Northwest Reproductive Justice Collaborative (NRJC).  Surge NW is committed to forging a creative vision of reproductive justice in the Northwest. The Collaborative brings together members of many northwest communities, including those often excluded from the mainstream movement for reproductive rights, to develop shared values, strategies, and actions to support the human, sexual, and reproductive rights of all.\r\n\r\nWe also work in collaboration with the Prison Doula Project. They see their work as a means to reproductive freedom and justice for the women we serve and resistance to the prison industrial complex (PIC). The Prison Doula Project is a grass roots collective providing informational, physical and emotional resources to incarcerated women and mothers that enhance and extend their reproductive choices.\r\n\r\nOur collaborations seek to address the devaluation of motherhood for parents involved in the criminal justice and child welfare systems. As Reproductive Justice advocates we recognized that historically and currently, an individual\u2019s lack of power and self-determination is mediated through the multiple oppressions of race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, age and immigration status. We see that controlling individuals through our child welfare, family law and criminal justice system is a strategic pathway to regulating entire communities and work with these coalitions to change that. The veteran parent group is starting a movement towards recognizing and valuing leadership by those directly effected by the child welfare system.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Feminist scholarship and women\u2019s rights organizations have been criticized because they essentialize women and assume characteristics that are not true for all women. The generic \u201cwoman\u201d is analyzed as a privileged woman, one who is white, middle class, heterosexual, and able-bodied.  Although, it is necessary to generalize in some form for political action, many issues that affect women lie at the intersection of both race and gender. The law as applied to the generic woman does not take into account the many ways that race, ethnicity, age, disability, or sexual orientation can interact with gender in a manner that enhances the experience of inequality. When claims on behalf of privileged woman are made, therefore, the result is often the marginalization of women who do not fit these categories. On the other hand, if legal organizations delved deeper into issues that affect the most vulnerable women in our community, such as incarcerated mothers, a new lens into the many ways in which states govern women\u2019s lives may be discovered.  By first addressing the issues of the most marginalized women in our society, we will enhance liberty for all women\u2019s reproductive lives, while at the same time as allowing justice for imprisoned women or trans individuals placed in women\u2019s prison based on their sexual assignment at birth.",

    "cycle_question": "The U.S. incarcerates more women than any other nation in the world, and incarcerates women of color disproportionately.  Many are mothers, whose children often end up in foster care.  Because of existing child welfare laws and poor access to legal information and representation, their ties to their children may be permanently severed.  This loss ripples through whole communities when children are adopted away from their families or spend their childhoods in the limbo of foster care.  Once women are released from confinement, whether on parole, probation or during re-entry, the obstacles for reunification or maintaining contact with their children are great.  Low income women receive legal representation at the dependency and termination stage, but are less likely to receive access to legal information and parental rights before these stages. Women with mental health and learning disabilities are at an even greater risk. In order to help reduce the chances of family separation, our project will establish a family law legal information and education clinic to give women family law and rights information early on, it will bring people together to address the way these systems work against them, and it will require that the system address their needs.",

This powerful program reduces isolation, promotes self-empowerment, enhances quality of life and meets the needs of women facing HIV and their families through peer support, advocacy, education and outreach. As a program of the YWCA Seattle | King | Snohomish, BABES helps drive the YWCA\u2019s mission to advance the quality of life for women of all ages, races and faiths, and their families.  \r\n\r\nBABES Network began with a diverse group of 13 women with HIV who met in one woman\u2019s home in 1989. These women gathered together to find peer support, something which they weren\u2019t finding at other support groups. They discovered that the issues they faced \u2013 such as domestic violence, fear of losing custody of our kids, the need for childcare, medical care by providers who understood women\u2019s needs \u2013 were not being addressed a system designed with upper-middle income white men in mind.  As the numbers grew, BABES found that more and more women spoke of their frustration with and alienation from the care service system, they felt empowered to create our own organization of support, advocacy, outreach and education for women with HIV. \r\n\r\nToday, BABES is the only program primarily serving the unique needs of women living with HIV in the Northwest. The program has grown from the kitchen table to one that not only provides case management, referrals and one-to-one support to BABES but it also builds connectedness and advocates for HIV prevention and resources. We strengthen the voice and build the leadership skills of each woman we serve to advocate for HIV positive women in our community. Going one step further, BABES fosters the confidence for needed services and social change.",

    "narrative3": "For a woman living with HIV, the daily struggle for health and stability can seem insurmountable. In addition to managing complicated medication regimens and appointments with multiple providers, the BABES Network clients also face the additional barriers of poverty, discrimination, cultural stigma and lack of health care access. Women are also often the providers and caregivers for their families, prioritizing the needs of their children before their own. \r\n\r\nBABES recognizes that social determinants, including a person\u2019s environment or economic status, can increase the difficulty for living healthy lives. Many societal systems and institutions have been designed to keep certain groups of people \u2013 such as people of color, people with low incomes, women, children and youth \u2013 disconnected and disenfranchised. In addition, HIV/AIDS services for men who have sex with men receive significantly more public funding and are more widely available than services targeting HIV/AIDS positive women. These systems have created a community with a legacy of inequity where the privileged benefit while others are marginalized.\r\n\r\nBABES Network  often exists as the only place for a positive woman to find the support, resources and voice she needs to build a stable and healthy life. Staff Peer Advocates and Peer Volunteers have similar experiences to the women they are supporting, and thus are well-positioned to address the multiple interconnected needs HIV positive women face. BABES addresses the lack of support, resources and leadership opportunities for the most marginalized women living with HIV in our community. \r\n\r\nOur staff Peer Advocates and Peer Volunteers empower BABES members and their families to fight for critical services to prevent HIV the transmission and provide support for people living with HIV/AIDS.   \r\nWe educate and train members in HIV awareness, leadership and advocacy, and connect them with opportunities to practice leadership. Our vision is that positive women will achieve leadership positions in the community to truly influence decisions that affect them and their families.\r\n\r\nOne way we leverage the strength of the BABES sisterhood is through the Our Leadership Circle \u2013 trainings, mentorship and volunteer opportunities to strengthen BABES members\u2019 leadership skills. This project takes our sisterhood to another level, where members learn how to use their HIV diagnosis as a source of strength, empowerment and grace. Our six strong, active Peer Volunteer leaders facilitate support groups, help with events and retreats, and lead workshops with staff.  These new leaders act as peer supports for other women living with HIV, and are a voice for all positive women. ",

We use a comprehensive approach as the best model to help those living with HIV continue living healthy, productive lives and prevent transmission of HIV. BABES plays a vital role in the continuum, through peer outreach that connects women with care providers, keeps them adherent to medications and offers a community of support. We will continue leadership development through our Leadership Circle and participate in community advocacy to ensure that the voices of our members are heard. As our network of leaders grows, we will expand our capacity to reach to more than 250 positive women and their affected family members in the Puget Sound region.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, we are serving a growing number of positive women from African countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Mali. A new peer-led African Born Social Gathering seeks to break down the stigma and shame that represent significant barriers for these BABES members.\r\n\r\nAnother priority is preparing members for Medicaid Expansion. Helping BABES members navigate the new care system will be a priority, as well as preparing members to advocate for themselves when these changes do occur \u2013 whether in the doctor\u2019s office or by reaching out to decision makers in Seattle and Olympia. \r\n\r\nBABES Network conducts evaluation of our program objectives on an on-going basis. We use qualitative and quantitative evaluation tools to collect data. As a program of the YWCA, our program data is entered and analyzed by the YWCA\u2019s Client Data team. Evaluation results are shared internally and externally to ensure we are meeting the needs of our members, improving program practices and also advocating for the services BABES members need.  ",

One way that BABES participates in WHACAN initiatives is through AIDS Action and Awareness Day in Olympia, WA. In March 2013, BABES staff, volunteers, and members traveled to Olympia to advocate for services critical to the health and stability of people living with HIV/AIDS. We continue to partner with other organizations and individuals to advocate for people affected by HIV in our region.\r\n\r\nBABES Peer Advocate Brenda Higgins participates in the Washington State Department of Health Community Programs Planning Group. This group functions to review and recommend guidelines and operational policies of the HIV client services Ryan White Part B community programs. Our participation in this group lends a consumer perspective and provides input addressing the impact of guidelines and policies on people living with HIV/AIDS. This network links agencies and groups providing HIV services to better coordinate HIV care and prevention activities.\r\n\r\nTo reach our goal of creating community and leadership opportunities for HIV positive women, we partner with a wide variety of local partners in addition to the two detailed above.

    "cycle_question": "We know that people living with HIV in the criminal justice system represent a relatively small portion of the inmate population. However, the ACLU reports that people with HIV/AIDS are disproportionately imprisoned.  While incarcerated, it can be hard to get needed medications and corrections facility staff may not have an adequate understanding of HIV or the importance of treatment adherence to maintain a patient\u2019s health. According to The AIDS Institute, inmates, particularly women, are afflicted with a concentration of the epidemics that face the general population. The concentration of diseases, sexually transmitted infections, mental disorders, and HIV/AIDS is exponentially higher among inmates and the highest among incarcerated women. While women are not a majority of the inmate population, their population is affected by these issues at staggering rates \u2013 and these women are at increased risk due to the lack of resources consistently and uniformly available to them.\r\n\r\nSome of our BABES Peer Advocates have been formerly incarcerated and have the experience that helps them relate to women currently or recently incarcerated. We are well positioned to help women empower themselves to make positive choices for themselves to engage in medical care and stay out of incarceration.\r\n\r\nWe also provide a crucial support to incarcerated HIV positive women as they transition from prison back into their communities. BABES Network connects these women to resources for their wide array of needs, including support services beyond HIV treatment. Providing a link to services for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women provides them the resources and support they need to reduce the likelihood of recidivism and maintain healthy lives.",

    "narrative1": "Enlace is an alliance of organizations in the United States and Mexico committed to organizing the working poor and broadening the base of organized low\u2010wage workers. We were established in 1998 by a group of low\u2010wage worker organizations that sought to overcome barriers to organizing. At that time, their greatest challenge was organizing workers whose employers were global corporations. Since then, we have coordinated several successful campaigns against global corporations and through those campaigns developed a methodology - the Integrated Organizing Approach (IOA). It combines internal capacity building techniques with strategic campaign development and geographically diverse mobilization to cultivate unique and effective campaigns.  In 2009, we launched the Enlace Institute where we share the IOA methodology with low-wage worker organizations and their allies. \r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, our membership determined that their greatest barrier to organizing had changed: immigrant detention and deportation in the United States had become the greatest obstacle to organizing low\u2010wage workers. We took the approach of following the money, which led us to the conclusion that the private prison industry\u2019s lobby (and its supporters in the financial services industry) was a major force behind the arrest and incarceration of low\u2010wage immigrants. Four days after our May 2011 initial campaign action in four cities (New York, Miami, Nashville, Tucson and Los Angeles), Wall Street hedge fund guru, Bill Ackman, divested Pershing Square Capital Management\u2019s $180+ million CCA holdings.

This change in ownership and in the way economic power is organized has made winning campaigns for social and economic justice increasingly difficult. While the Private Prison Divestment Campaign is focused on the private prison industry (Corrections Corporation of America - CCA, and the Geo Group), we must also challenge its supporters in the financial services industry, such as Wells Fargo, Fidelity (FMR) and Lazard.

Currently this sub\u2010committee is reaching out to criminal justice and African American organizations, such as The New Jim Crow and faith groups, and to a broad base of immigrant-led organizations, such as the Center for Intercultural Organizing and VOZ in Portland, and El Comite Pro Reforma and Casa Latina in Seattle.\r\n3.

For example, between 1990 and 1997, CCA\u2019s revenues increased tenfold, with profits amounting to $50 million. In 2000 and 2001, they began to lobby the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but after September 11, 2001, they recognized a tremendous opportunity and focused their efforts on immigrant populations. [Although the Geo Group also managed to get the first contract to manage the facility at Guantanamo Bay]. \r\n\r\nThe result has been millions of people of color and immigrants incarcerated without benefit to society, communities or families.  On the contrary, the only people who have benefitted from these harsh laws and policies are the investors in the industry. \r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "In Oregon we see that leaders, whether elected officials, business executives or nonprofit directors and board members, are not representative of the true diversity of our communities, yet they make so many of the critical decisions for our increasingly multicultural population. \r\n\r\nFrom the demand we have had from underrepresented youth, it is clear there are not enough youth-led opportunities for youth from underrepresented communities to gain hands-on organizing and leadership skills, practice them in tangible ways and get individualized support and coaching needed to address the multiple barriers they face so that they can reach their personal, educational, and professional goals, and become the leaders our communities need.\r\n\r\nAt the root are economic, educational and institutional systems that reinforce inequality, racism, gender discrimination and the marginalization of youth with disabilities, formerly incarcerated youth, gang-affected youth, teen parents, undocumented youth and queer youth. We believe that their increased access to leadership is a systemic change, that the lack of emerging leaders from under-represented communities reinforces a socioeconomic and political system run by people of privilege, who in turn tend to make decisions that benefit the privileged. \r\n\r\nMomentum Alliance is the only youth-designed and -led organization we know of that supports youth to achieve success, with the ultimate goal of preparing new leaders. We work to connect youth leaders across movements, geography and backgrounds and to serve as a launching pad for youth to become the next leaders in the social justice movements they care most about. We have demonstrated that with the necessary funding, coaching and curricula, it is possible to assist youth in transitioning from vulnerable mental, physical, financial and social health to becoming thriving individuals and effective leaders. Most importantly, we believe it is other youth who have faced similar obstacles and achieved their goals who are best suited to inspire and engage their peers. \r\n\r\n\u201cMomentum Alliance provided the opportunity for me to come out as undocumented and helped me start my own business. MA flew me to Atlanta to meet with other national undocumented youth leaders. I came back motivated to cofound Oregon DreamActivist. I now realize that I am an immigrant rights leader who can influence public policy and mobilize community members at the local, state and national levels.\u201d -Jaime, 27\r\n\r\nWe aim to demonstrate Momentum Alliance as a sustainable youth-led non-profit. Our \u201cStep Up, Step Back\u201d coaching model, where every leader within our organization is sharing their knowledge and coaching someone else in learning their skills, is engrained at every level of our organizational structure. This model is coupled with a transparent culture where everyone is involved in decision-making and participates in sharing their personal story. \r\n",

Within SAP, we break down walls between diverse youth, building confidence and sustained alliances; we set and reach our personal, educational, and professional goals with individualized coaching and Personal Development Plans; and we learn and practice leadership skills in real-life organizing efforts. To accomplish this, SAP provides Summer, Winter and Spring Break Leadership Camps, monthly \u201cWhat\u2019s SAppening\u201d Events and year-round individualized coaching. Youth Leaders organize and mobilize youth from their communities, and they plan, design, facilitate and evaluate camp activities, so that Camps are not only an opportunity for the participants, but are critical practical leadership opportunities for the organizers. \r\n\t\r\nLeveraging Momentum (LM) meets the needs that arose from SAP and other young organizers around the region. Many SAP Youth Leaders were ready to seek positions of leadership and decision-making in the community, whether on non-profit boards, grant-making committees, government task forces, elected offices or professional management. LM is a network of leaders under 30 seeking to diversify decision-makers in the public, private, and non-profit sectors; alter relations of power; and make systems more equitable and accessible. LM works towards this by supporting youth in setting and reaching their leadership goals through individualized coaching and trainings; matching youth with leadership opportunities; and organizing a network of 200 diverse youth across the region. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation and strateginc plans we have developed with independent evaluators for both SAP and LM will help us determine if we have met our goals and objectives as well as let us know where we can improve on our work and where we are doing things well and efficiently.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Our origins in the \u201cPapers\u201d film project and our non-profit model are built on intersectional and inter-movement alliances. The \u201cPapers\u201d documentary film project was a critical tool in connecting the immigrant rights and LGBTQ movements, garnering grants from Arcus Foundation and the Evelyn & Walter J. Haas Jr. Fund to do just that. Our ethics as an organization and our mission are focused on building alliances among and between individuals and movements in a genuine and sustainable way.\r\n\r\nFor example, MA Leaders, both undocumented and documented, Latino, African American, Jewish and Muslim, partnered with Oregon DreamActivist, an undocumented-led organization, and held regular meetings with undocumented young people in the majority. Undocumented youth developed a one-pager for the TE Coalition around preferred messaging. They also designed posters and social media images to align with this messaging. After ten years of passionate work by allies, Tuition Equity was finally signed into law in Oregon. This was the first time undocumented youth were in the legislative strategy and organizing meetings, ensuring their best interests were being met in the process. Post-session, we created a video about the work, which can be found at http://www.momentumalliance.org. \r\n\r\nMA programs are about partnership and collaboration, whether it is LM staff member, Laquisha Minnieweather working with Alex Horsey from Project Believe in Me, a youth-led anti-bullying initiative, to design and facilitate a workshop at the Oregon Queer Youth Summit or co-founder Jaime Limon Guzman providing peer coaching to youth organizer Nicole Johnson from Organizing People Activating Leaders (OPAL) to build her campaign skills to ensure youth continue to have access to public transportation through Youth Pass. Jaime has provided Nicole with peer coaching on recruitment, preparing testimony and testifying. \r\n",

It is inherent in our work and our purpose for existing.

We represent six religions.\r\n\r\nYou can see it in our workshops which include:\r\n\u201cGot Your Back: How Muslim, LGBTQ, Undocumented, Gang-affected Youth and Youth with Disabilities Have Become Friends and Allies.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhy Aren\u2019t They Listening? Building More Effective Youth/Adult Partnerships\u201d \r\n\r\nYou can see it in our advocacy efforts. Youth Organizers practiced advocacy and wrote and gave testimony in front of Metro Regional Government and the Oregon State Legislature on Tuition Equity for undocumented students. They are learning about efforts to stop police profiling and increase police accountability, reform the criminal justice system and prevent bullying. \r\n\r\nYou can see it in the new outrage that has emerged from truly knowing others who are different from oneself, not in a \u201cdiversity training,\u201d but in hands-on, day-to-day relationship building activities. Two Youth Organizers, one who attends Special Ed and the other who attends General Ed at Summer Camp and discovered they went to the same school but had never seen one another and began to see the inequities in their educational experiences. They decided to go back to school to try to break down the isolation between General Ed students and SPED students. Because we believe relationships are the first point of community organizing, they hosted a SAP bowling trip for students in both their peer groups to get to know one another. \r\n\r\nYou can see by our partners and those referring youth to us and seeking our services. Some partners have included: Linfield College, Lewis and Clark\u2019s Center for Career Engagement, Winningmark, Portland State University, staff from Evergreen and Vancouver school districts, City of Portland\u2019s Future Connect and Ride Connection. Our camps have had referrals from DHS, County Court Advocates, Outside In, Independent Living Program for foster youth in Clackamas, and Clackamas County Bridges to Housing for youth transitioning from homelessness. We work with many schools to outreach.

AFSC is attempting to address these issues through the YUIR group which offers a powerful participatory experience for young people designed to inspire a lifetime of community involvement by helping to form engaged advocates for peace and social change. Facilitators and participants utilize popular education modalities to shape activism and community organizing strategies. Through these meetings and other planned actions YUIR builds knowledge and skills while providing opportunities for activism.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 the YUIR group started work on the EPIC campaign that will advocate for education and juvenile justice policies that disrupt the flow of the \u201cschool to prison pipeline\u201d for low income and youth of color in Greater Seattle. The EPIC Campaign is an important leadership development opportunity for the YUIR participants.   Designed and run by young people in the YUIR group this Campaign will seek to uncover and highlight the reasons for these disparities and advocate for alternatives.    \r\nIn February county officials proposed a property tax levy to build a new $210 million-dollar juvenile detention facility.  This proposed plan has offered an opportunity for the YUIR to mobilize the EPIC Campaign group toward a direct community action movement. In the coming months, the EPIC Campaign will be drafting an action plan that reflects justice for youth that would create more holistic and equitable alternatives to the current juvenile justice system.  They will also design and implement a community education, outreach and advocacy campaign directed at this issue.  \r\n\r\nThe YUIR group is focusing on halting the construction plans for the new jail facility and also on designing alternative models of restorative justice and youth prevention programs.  EPIC Campaign members are discussing and charting what would they do with the resources allocated to the facility and how these proposed interventions could change the current system.  Drafting a comprehensive alternative plan (with broad community input) is one part of the EPIC Campaign. The parallel track is changing the conversation about the juvenile justice system starting at the grassroots level with community forums - bringing the EPIC plan to decision makers and the media.  \r\n",

The Youth Undoing Institutional Racism Program\u2019s EPIC Campaign directly challenges racism and oppression by supporting low-income youth of color in becoming aware and taking action in their communities. The YUIR program work is led by young people from communities who are most affected by the issues of racism and oppression. 79% of the Advisory Committee members for YUIR are people of color and 50% of them are under 25.  The director, program assistant and program intern are also people of color with one staff person under 25.

Through this campaign, EPIC will investigate the root causes of juvenile incarceration in King county and will examine how youth incarceration, particularly youth of color, perpetuates race and class inequities, thereby reinforcing a socio-political climate where youth of color face greater obstacles to obtaining jobs, housing, and accessing education. With a focus on ending juvenile incarceration, which disproportionately affects youth of color and other non-heterosexual whites, EPIC hopes to create more opportunities for youth to have their basic needs met by freeing up public funds for front end human capital investments, i.e. anti-racist and anti-bias education in schools, job training, holistic medical treatment. Solutions will be based on restorative justice, alternatives to detention, trauma support, support around impact and trauma.  Through a holistic analysis of the current criminal justice system issues of economic injustice, racism and other forms of oppression (sexism, homophobia\u2026) will be examined as part of an overall system that has created such vast inequality in the justice system.  \r\n",

    "cycle_question": "The EPIC Campaign directly addresses issues of the juvenile justice system by examining and documenting experiences of the current juvenile justice system and forming a comprehensive alternative plan to the proposed new facility.  \r\n\r\nThough African-American youth are no more likely to use or sell illicit drugs than their white peers, they are far more likely to be arrested. The over-incarceration and over-policing of youth of color from low-income backgrounds is largely caused by structural violence (structural racism, war on poverty, disparate levels of police surveillance in urban low income neighborhoods). The youth who are leading the EPIC campaign know from personal experience and national/local statistics that the juvenile justice system targets youth of color, particularly poor youth of color.  Using this knowledge EPIC is developing an alternative action plan for King County. The EPIC plan will outline a path for reallocating the funds for the proposed youth jail to community based projects and services that best serve the needs of King County\u2019s youth such as effective, well researched alternatives to detention, the extension of rec center operating hours, and advanced anti-racism training for police and court officials in King County.\r\n\r\n Punitive measures that lock up youth drain the community of potential leaders and sharply increase the probability that these young people will continue in the criminal justice system as adults. Youth jobs, parks and rec. activities and afterschool programs will keep youth from engaging in behavior that will put them in the prison pipeline. \r\n\r\nIn terms of social resources, the U.S.\u2019s current approach to criminal justice is a huge financial drain of taxpayer dollar, leaving fewer resources for other critical human needs.  EPIC is focused on moving the conversation from a western based punitive model to a model that restorative and healing for individuals and the community.  \r\n",

    "narrative1": "Enlace is an alliance of organizations in the United States and Mexico committed to organizing the working poor and broadening the base of organized low\u2010wage workers. We were established in 1998 by a group of low\u2010wage worker organizations that sought to overcome barriers to organizing. At that time, their greatest challenge was organizing workers whose employers were global corporations. Since then, we have coordinated several successful campaigns against global corporations and through those campaigns developed a methodology - the Integrated Organizing Approach (IOA). It combines internal capacity building techniques with strategic campaign development and geographically diverse mobilization to cultivate unique and effective campaigns. We have worked with groups developing advanced teamwork skills among staff and leaders to address evolving strategy, evaluation, accountability, and organizational structure and capacity. Two examples of Enlace\u2019s campaigns and accomplishments include: the complex four\u2010year campaign of Enlace member SEDEPAC against Sara Lee Corporation in Coahuila, Mexico which resulted in an unprecedented union neutrality agreement by Sara Lee; and the campaign against Korean corporation Pung Kook by Enlace member SINTTIM which resulted in the company, which had closed shop leaving workers without required severance pay, reopening bank accounts in Mexico in order to make these payments. In 2009, we launched the Enlace Institute where we share the IOA methodology with low-wage worker organizations and their allies. Several years ago, our membership determined that their greatest barrier to organizing had changed: immigrant detention and deportation in the United States had become the greatest obstacle to organizing low\u2010wage workers. We took the approach of following the money, which led us to the conclusion that the private prison industry\u2019s lobby (and its supporters in the financial services industry) was a major force behind the arrest and incarceration of low\u2010wage immigrants. In May 2011 we launched the Private Prison Divestment Campaign.",

    "narrative3": "Over the past decades organizations working for social change faced increasing obstacles to winning campaigns. Battles for change, originally against local or national companies, became battles against global corporations. Now the financial services industry has become a major player - either through direct ownership of organizations that prey upon middle and working class communities or through their financial and political support of these organizations (example: the private prison industry). This change in ownership and in the way economic power is organized has made winning campaigns for social and economic justice increasingly difficult. While the Private Prison Divestment Campaign is focused on the private prison industry (Corrections Corporation of America - CCA, and the Geo Group), we must also challenge its supporters in the financial services industry, such as Wells Fargo, Fidelity (FMR) and Lazard. \r\n\r\nThe Campaign challenges the financial services industry, both directly (through our actions against Wells Fargo, for example) and indirectly, by taking on the lobbyists shared by both industries and the politicians who support them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, both local and national organizations have grown substantially beyond their beginnings and now must focus on a variety of challenges they did not have to confront initially. The need for dynamic, impactful low-wage worker organizations will extend beyond the tenure of today\u2019s crop of leaders. This fact illuminates the urgency for the field to develop the means to create cohesive leadership teams across the field of worker centers. The Peer Trainer Program and our new pilot, the Directors Charmed Circle Project, address the need for organizations with otherwise limited resources to acquire new capabilities at all levels of staff and leadership. Both are tasked with providing tools for leaders to think strategically and to realign their organizations internally to meet the challenge of their campaigns (and win campaigns against the financial services industry and its allies). In the Peer Trainer Program, participants apply dilemmas they are actually facing to planning and evaluation frameworks, leaving each session with a fully realized plan for an event, campaign or project. The Charmed Circle project is a response to the fact that successful social change movements are launched and advanced by organizations led by notable leaders who are each surrounded by a cohesive team of core leaders. Together with the top leader these teams form a charmed circle that advance the organization in ways that insure growing impact well beyond the time and scope of all individuals involved. Over the next three years, we will develop and implement this program which will work intensively with organizations to develop comprehensive leadership. \r\n\r\nThe Campaign and Institute complement each other - a direct action campaign and a methodology that prepares organizations to win.\r\n",

A major campaign objective is to build permanent alliances. The Steering Committee has designated a Movement Building subcommittee; its purpose is to recruit new partners and allies to ensure the inclusion of all organizations whose constituencies are negatively impacted by the manipulation of public policy in support of the private prison industry. Currently this sub\u2010committee is reaching out to criminal justice and African American organizations, such as The New Jim Crow, and to a broad base of immigrant-led organizations, such as the Center for Intercultural Organizing and VOZ in Portland, and El Comite Pro Reforma and Casa Latina in Seattle.\r\n3.

Some have come to the Campaign as allies, and other because their constituent populations have also been devastated by the private prison industry and its lobbying for stricter enforcement. It has been a great opportunity to further build the social justice movement, because the Campaign has such a great number of different types organizations that support it.

Working closely with incarcerated Native Americans, we experienced firsthand the \u2018revolving door\u2019 known as recidivism. Inmates would confide in us, \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to go, I don\u2019t know what I will do.\u201d In February 2006 we formed a Board of Directors and began the process of crafting our mission and purpose: To prevent incarceration of Native Americans and provide assistance to incarcerated Native Americans who are proactively working toward creating a better life for themselves, their children, and their communities. Upon receiving non-profit status in 2007, we have continuously worked to promote and develop culturally competent pre and post incarceration programs which aid in prevention, responsibility, respect and empowerment of individuals, families and communities.  \r\n\r\nThe heart of our organization is our volunteer base, which has grown to over 70 community members. With their unwavering support, RLTS is gaining recognition within the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) administration and Native communities as a strong voice for incarcerated Native people. We are proud of our core prison programs, which have expanded and been refined over the last year in order to improve outcomes and serve more individuals.

If I hadn\u2019t come to prison, I would never have seen a model of strong, responsible, respectful women.\u201d RLTS client.\r\n\r\nRLTS believes the high disparity levels of intergenerational incarceration among Native Americans is directly related to repeated historical traumas, violence, poverty, and substance abuse experienced and passed down through the generations. Historical trauma has been described as \u201cthe distress and suffering resulting from numerous compounding historically traumatic events experienced by a community over several generations\u201d (Yellow Horse Brave Heart, 1996). \r\n\r\nThe root causes of Native American incarceration, substance abuse addiction and parenting problems lie within the historical trauma that our culture has endured, including:\r\n\u2022\tA legacy of genocide so horrendous that it caused deep intergenerational trauma\u2014separating Indigenous people from their cultures, languages, traditions and families.\r\n\u2022\tA trauma of this magnitude often manifests as violence and addictions, and leads to involvement with the criminal justice system\u2014Incarceration is intergenerational.\r\n\u2022\tA culture of widely held stereotypes regarding Native people, as well as incarcerated people, that discourage compassion and basic human kindness.\r\n\r\nMany First Nations people are now using the term \u201csoul wound\u201d or \u201cwounded spirit\u201d to describe the mental, physical and spiritual consequences the cumulative effect of colonialism, genocide and oppression has had on them as a People. We work to address the overrepresentation of Native Americans in Oregon prisons and jails. This disparity, coupled with the cycle of chemical addiction, violence, abuse, hatred, hopelessness and neglect in Native American communities fuels our commitment to supply transition information, guidance and support to Native American individuals, families and communities. \r\n\r\nRLTS is the ONLY organization in Oregon working to address Native American incarceration through direct treatment programs. The work of RLTS connects with the progressive work of our community, including but not limited to: homelessness, anti-racism work, Native sovereignty, mental health advocacy, anti-violence, child abuse, poverty and social justice issues. While the Department of Corrections budget continues to spiral out of control, the State ignores the glaring needs of incarcerated people: education, treatment, mental health counseling, job skills, and mentoring. Many of our clients have symptoms of internalized oppression; they carry the weight of generational racism and oppressive regimes that have blacked out traditional native teachings and ways of life. We draw upon our ancestors, our traditions, to rise above oppression. By rebuilding a broken strand of our social construction, RLTS\u2019s work with this underrepresented population addresses the underlying causes of Native American incarceration and contributes to the whole system of social change.\r\n",

Our volunteers spend countless hours with clients, working with and tutoring the student to ensure access and success in attaining a college degree \u2014 a ticket to a new life. \r\n\r\nUtilizing curriculum endorsed by the National Indian Child Welfare Association allows us to serve incarcerated parents with a positive standard of behavior to emulate, and a number of basic skills from which to actualize successful parenting behaviors and values. Through this valuable program, our collaboration is addressing the critical need for parenting training to reduce the effects of incarceration on Native American children. Native American\u2019s represent 2% of Oregon\u2019s population, yet 27% of the Multnomah County foster system are identified as children of Native American decent. Without prison-based treatment programs, transitional help and post-incarceration support, the vicious cycle of recidivism will continue to effect the youngest members of our community and continue the cycle of dysfunction that plagues our community. \r\n\r\nOur successful collaboration with ODOC\u2019s administration is a critical component for the success of our program. \u201cRed Lodge provides culturally appropriate practices and approaches to rehabilitation that our Native American inmates can't get anywhere else.

    "narrative6": "Loretta grew up in a very abusive household, starting on the Red Lake Chippewa Reservation in Minnesota. Her first real trauma was watching her six-year-old brother drown by falling through the ice and being blamed by her father for not being able to save him. She was eight years old at the time. Her father was abusive. After he threw her mother out of a third story window, Loretta and her four siblings were taken to Oregon. They quickly fell into the Foster Care System.  \r\n\r\nLoretta got pregnant at 15 and became an emancipated minor. Returning to her mother and tribe, Loretta had three other children. She lived in a domestic violence relationship and used drugs and alcohol to numb herself.  She was soon convicted of delivery of a controlled substance and endangering minors, and sentenced to three and a half years. Her children entered the foster system. \r\n\r\nDuring her time of incarceration, she began fighting and served 13 months in segregation. Her RLTS mentor would visit weekly and talk with her through a six-inch square window in a four inch steel door. \u201cShe was my only visitor, and she made me realize I was capable of being someone different.\u201d Afterward, Loretta went to the Talking Circle, Spring Celebration and Sweat Lodge ceremonies offered in prison. \u201cI felt like a new person.\u201d \r\n\r\nRLTS serves an almost forgotten segment of our community \u2013a portion of our community where your men die, your women use drugs, your kids are raised by the foster care system. We share the unknown\u2014yet eerily similar\u2014stories of our clients within our community, in order to raise awareness and promote understanding. Our organization works on racial justice, economic justice, environmental justice, and criminal justice for incarcerated and recently released Native Americans. For many of our clients\u2014like Loretta\u2014RLTS volunteers represent the first contact with a Native individual who fights for their social justice, and helps them change the direction of their life. \r\n\r\nRLTS Board Members and volunteers take a strong stand with clients. Becoming mentors, they exemplify how to lead, how to value the hard work that is to come and how to go forward as a self-respecting member of society. Most importantly, they exemplify how to change: Seven of the RLTS Board and Advisory Members have a history of incarceration and every Board Member and volunteer shares the identity of having family members or loved ones who are, or have been, incarcerated. This fuels their commitment to preventing incarceration by promoting healthy choices, educating, supporting, providing advocacy, and breaking down the systematic oppression that plagues our Native communities. \r\n",

But, they will continue to be punished for their crimes due to stigmatization, stereotypes, and laws and policies that operate to bar them from productively participating in society. The continued punishment of individuals with criminal records due to laws and policies that allow legal discrimination against \u201cex-felons\u201d has been called \u201ccivil death,\u201d but more commonly referred to as \u201ccollateral consequences.\u201d In Oregon, collateral consequences include: employment discrimination, barriers to obtaining certain occupational licenses, housing discrimination by private landlords, ineligibility for public and federally subsidized housing, ineligibility for federal student loans, suspension of driver\u2019s licenses, and a variety of other barriers to the most basic needs. To exacerbate these obstacles, Native Americans are generally released from prison with little to no resources. It is no surprise that these individuals struggling just to survive frequently return to prison. The U.S. criminal justice system has essentially systematically degraded whole segments of the nation\u2019s population to a life of poverty, second-class status, and intergenerational incarceration based on race. \r\n\tThis mass incarceration has an even greater detrimental impact on Native American communities, which are already struggling with the disparaging effects of historical trauma. The RLTS Legal Services Program will help incarcerated and formerly incarcerated Native Americans navigate the laws stacked against them, advocate for themselves, and better plan around these civil legal barriers. This assistance will empower RLTS clients to break out of that survival mode so that they can focus on the healing and growth necessary to effectively nurture their families, end the cycle of intergenerational incarceration, and positively contribute to the restoration of their Native American communities. \r\n",

Starting in 2006 with a demonstration grant from the Office of Refugee Resettlement to provide community building and cultural adjustment services for newly arrived African refugees, Africa House has expanded to offer 15 culturally responsive programs tailored to the needs of more than 25,000 African immigrant/refugee children, youth and adults living in Oregon.  Africa House has a diverse staff of 14 individuals speaking 20 languages from many African countries including Ethiopia, Somali, Burundi, Congo, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Kenya, Eritrea, and Chad.   Last year alone, more than 1,500 Africans sought services like emergency housing, ESL classes and youth mentoring/gang intervention services at Africa House.   Operated under the administrative umbrella of the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization\u2019s (IRCO) nonprofit status, Africa House has received national recognition as the only community-driven focal point center moving beyond interethnic and intercultural conflict to open its doors to all African ethnic groups.  Guided by an Advisory Board composed of Portland\u2019s diverse African refugee and immigrant leaders committed to social change, Africa House represents the first coalition of African leaders in the U.S.  who have moved beyond a long history of conflict based on colonialism, tribalism and religious differences in their continent to collectively address significant disparities faced by African families living in Oregon.

    "narrative3": "A 2013 report conducted in partnership with the Coalition of Communities of Color found that African immigrants and refugees have the highest child poverty rate in the Portland area at 56.4% and an overall poverty rate of 37%.  African household incomes are approximately half those of whites at $26,696 per year, their unemployment rate is 25% higher than whites, and only 38% of the community has the resources to purchase their own homes compared to 62% of whites.  In addition to these disparities the African community faces inequity in education, child welfare, juvenile and adult justice, social services, voting, health, public housing, and homeless services but specific data on these inequalities is difficult to come by.  \r\nThe roots of these inequalities stem from both cultural and institutional barriers that fail to recognize the experiences of African immigrants and refugees.  Language barriers, lack of knowledge of American society, and American employers\u2019 unwillingness to recognize work and education credentials from home countries are just some of the issues that prevent Africans from obtaining quality jobs.  In addition, the specific needs of the African community are rarely reflected when developing public policy, as government officials often aggregate Africans with other immigrants or African American populations despite their dissimilar problems.  Furthermore, because African immigrants and refugees come to the U.S with a limited understanding of the political process, they often lack the capacity to publicly voice their concerns over inequities they encounter.  While Africa House provides programs and services to help overcome cultural barriers and alleviate poverty-related issues, we do not have the ability to directly address these institutional barriers.\r\nHowever, this is a deficiency that we are actively seeking to remedy. Africa House has begun to focus intensively on instilling Africans with the competence to participate in the political process themselves.  We have done so by developing programs that seek out and cultivate community leaders, promote community organizing, connect African immigrants and refugees to policy makers, and provide them with the skills to engage in lobbying, advocacy work, and participation in public forums.  The African Leadership Development Initiative has worked to address these concerns, resulting in the creation of four African Leadership committees that respectively focus on engaging both African and mainstream communities in developing strategies to overcome policy and advocacy, economic development, housing, and education disparities.  The African community is working to take the lead on initiatives that affect them by directly addressing their issues with state and local legislatures and members of the Portland community.  By helping African immigrants find a voice, they will work to help others understand the struggles they face while developing long-term, cooperative solutions that foster diversity and equality for all in the greater Portland area.\r\n",

Strategies include (1) increase leadership capacity within the African communities overall and Africa House Advisory Board in particular, (2) engage African leaders as advocates in creating social and systemic change, and (3) utilize the collective base of skills and leadership to address past tensions and collaboratively address racial and ethnic disparities.  Potential long-term goals of the project will be increased understanding of elected officials/leaders about the strengths/needs/disparities of Africans in Oregon and increased public funding for culturally responsive services for this underserved and marginalized community.  \r\n\r\nHow will you assess whether you have met your objectives and goals?\r\nMeasurement will use quantitative methods like number of Advisory Board members, number of trained community leaders, number of lobbying/advocacy presentations, and increased funding for culturally responsive services.

Evaluation plan will use tracking forms with both quantitative and qualitative information which will be gathered monthly and reviewed quarterly between Mr. Dogo, IRCO\u2019s Executive Director and Africa House Advisory Board/IRCO Board members.

    "narrative5": "One of our most crucial partnerships to date is with the Coalition of Communities of Color (CCC).  The CCC is comprised of 40 culturally specific organizations around Portland that have come together with the purpose of addressing socioeconomic disparities, institutional racism, and inequity in public services.  Members of the Coalition have pushed for increased political power and greater legislative representation for under-voiced populations to acquire public support and resources required to achieve prosperity and wellness.  One of CCC\u2019s most successful projects has been the publication of \u201cCommunities of Color in Multnomah County: An Unsettling Profile\u201d, a report which provided comprehensive data on the socioeconomic disparities that communities of color face in the Greater Portland area.  Africa House contributed substantially to this groundbreaking report as a primary member of CCC though community surveying and information gathering within the African community.\r\nAfrica House also works in close collaboration with the City of Portland Office of Neighborhood Involvement (ONI) to promote community diversity, civic leadership education, and community organizing efforts. Our role has been to serve as a liaison that connects representatives of the city to members of the African community. This partnership with ONI provides Africans immigrants and refugees the information and skills they need to actively participate in the civic engagement and political process, creates an opportunity for members of the African community to inform and educate policy makers about their unique cultures, fosters a more diverse and accepting community, and wins allies to help achieve their goals.  \r\nWorking in partnership with other cultural groups though CCC and directly engaging the government and mainstream Portland community with ONI, we can develop an effective, unified movement that will provide a voice for previously unheard populations and help bridge the gap between disadvantaged communities of color and the institutions that can assist them.  \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Africa House is committed to working toward racial justice, self-sufficiency, and a quality standard of living for the African immigrant and refugee population in Portland. The aforementioned collaborative efforts with CCC and ONI demonstrate just some of the ways in which we are reaching out to the broader community to overcome issues of institutional racism, discrimination, and economic injustice that exist among all communities of color in Multnomah County.  In addition to these partnerships, we have instituted a number of programs within our own organization that implement multifaceted and long-term strategies which allow the communities we serve to address several issues of inequity at the same time.  \r\nThe primary example of this is our African Leadership Development Initiative and the African Leadership Committees that have been formed from it.  The four committees respectively focus on developing strategies, engaging the African community, and working with public officials to overcome policy and advocacy, economic development, housing, and education issues.  While these committees each have a specific area focus, their goals are ultimately interconnected, as are the policies they create to achieve them.  For instance, a focus of our economic development committee is to create an African business association that will not only strengthen the viability of African owned and operated small businesses through business networking and cooperation, but will promote these businesses to the general public by and bring attention to the culturally diverse goods and services they provide.  In addition, our education committee believes that one of the best ways to help immigrant and refugee students who are struggling in the public school system is to educate both faculty and student bodies about their unique cultures and learning styles and promote and integrated learning environment.\r\nAdditionally, many of our other programs have taken a multidimensional approach in an attempt to address all of the corresponding and underlying issues that our clients face.  For instance, our Anti-poverty program not only delivers immediate energy and rental assistance for those facing power shutoffs or evictions, but it provides recipients with access to resources and training that encourage financial literacy and responsibility, and help them increase their income.  Furthermore, in addition to offering in person tutoring for students struggling in school, our Social and Support Services for Educational Success provides one-on-one case work that address family, economic, and social issues that might be affecting student success.  Overall we understand that the core problems African immigrants and refugees face are multifaceted, and as a result our programs seek not only to promote racial justice for the African community, but to directly address the unfair and oppressive issues that cause them in the first place.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "The Washington State Parent Advocacy Network (WSPAN) is an association of parents who are \u201cveterans\u201d of the child welfare system who collaborate to improve outcomes for families entering that system.   It is comprised of a network of eight local Parent Advocacy Committees and the Washington State Parent Advocacy Committee (WSPAC), a statewide organization that meets quarterly for networking, planning, and training.  The WSPAN mission is to bring the parent voice into the development of child welfare policy and practice; promote improved and equitable outcomes for all children and parents regardless of their race, gender, or circumstance; and advocate for parent leadership in the direct service, training, and public awareness activities that strengthen and support those families.\r\n\r\nThe WSPAN began in April 2007, when Catalyst for Kids and a \u201cveteran parent\u201d leader convened the first WSPAC meeting.   Catalyst for Kids continues to provide for WSPAN development and support.  Significant WSPAN legislative policy work began in 2011 when, as a member of the Strong Family Northwest cohort, the WSPAN benefited from the robust advocacy training and technical assistance provided as well as from a modest grant that enabled the development of an infrastructure to support its advocacy work.\r\n\r\nAccomplishments:\r\n\u2022\tWSPAN  policy priorities for the 2012 and 2013 Washington State Legislative sessions all became law (see www.wspan.org/WSPAN_Policy.html) \r\n\u2022\tVeteran parents are active and sought after members of statewide advisory committees including the Washington State Racial Disproportionality Advisory Committee; the Children, Youth and Family Services Advisory Committee; and the Washington State Commission for Children in Foster Care.\r\n\u2022\tLegislators and other policy makers frequently attend WSPAC meetings to gain the parent perspective on proposed policy and practice.\r\n\u2022\tThe WSPAN received the 2013 Children\u2019s Justice Conference Lee Ann Miller Award as the organization making the greatest contribution in furthering the goals of the Children's Justice Act.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "On January 1, 2013, there were 9,758 Washington State children living in foster care. These data represent a trauma for both the children involved and their parents.   While there is unambiguous agreement that children must be protected from unsafe living environments, it is by no means clear that removing children from their parents is the best avenue for achieving this goal.  The prevailing (although incrementally changing) child welfare paradigm, supported in part by policy, outmoded practice, and categorical funding, is that children should be removed from unsafe families and placed with good and caring substitute families.  This paradigm must be changed, with policy, practice and funding all recognizing that in most situations children are best off with their parents, and that, with necessary services and supports, most parents can safely provide for their children\u2019s safety and well-being.  \r\n\r\nChild welfare involved families are among the most marginalized families in our community.  In the face of the daunting circumstances faced by these families, it is perhaps understandable that the predominant child welfare paradigm has been to remove children from these parents instead of giving parents support to personally provide for their children\u2019s safety and well-being. The challenges can be overwhelming.  The primary federal funding source for child welfare services, Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, provides states with funding only after a child has been removed from his family and is living in a foster home or in a subsidized adoptive family.  Social workers and policy makers who care about children can tend to believe that children\u2019s needs can be better served by a family other than their birth family.   Notwithstanding an essentially progressive child welfare practice model adopted by the Children\u2019s Administration, white, middle class professionals are not immune from bias based on race, economic status, and life style.  The institutionalized racism prevalent in all systems with which families engage creates additional barriers to success for the families of color who find themselves involved with the child welfare system.  Parents who are already marginalized by life circumstances are further marginalized and stigmatized by a system that is often biased against them.\r\n\r\nThe WSPAN changes this system by bringing the parent voice into the development of child welfare policy and practice. WSPAN members use their personal stories of life transformation to educate and inspire policy makers into recognizing the validity of the WSPAN message \u2013 \u201cPeople Change/Families Reunite.\u201d  They get trained in racial equity, policy and advocacy; identify issues underlying the barriers to parents\u2019 success and develop policy priorities to address those barriers; recruit additional parents to work with them; gain legislative champions; collaborate with other coalitions; lobby for legislative change; celebrate success; and begin the process all over again.  \r\n",

    "narrative5": "Catalyst for Kids, itself, is a coalition of child welfare professionals, consumers, advocates, and decision-makers partnering to bring about transformational change of the child welfare system.  Similarly, the Washington State Parent Advocacy Network \u2013 which is staffed and supported by Catalyst for Kids, and whose policy work will be supported by this grant - is a coalition of veteran parents and professional advisors who are partnering to effect social change.\r\n\r\nBoth Catalyst for Kids and the WSPAN participate in other social change coalitions, including: \r\n\r\nKing County Coalition on Disproportionality (www.kccrd.org) \u2013 Purpose is to eliminate racial disproportionality in the child welfare system.  CFK provides staffing to the Coalition and WSPAN members participate.  The King County Coalition has been instrumental in educating Washington State policy makers about disproportionality and in influencing legislation that requires the state to work toward its elimination.\r\n\r\nLow Income Housing Alliance (www.wliha.org) \u2013 Purpose is to ensure that all state residents thrive in safe, healthy, affordable homes.  WSPAN actively collaborates with LIHA in advancing a shared policy agenda.  In both 2012 and 2013, one WSPAN policy priority related to Fair Tenant Screening, bills that were primarily championed by LIHA and actively supported by WSPAN members.  Both in 2011 and 2012, WSPAN members won LIHA legislative advocacy awards.\r\n\r\nThere is significant crossover between the WSPAN and both of these Coalitions.  WSPAN members have been educated about disproportionality and are committed to actions that work toward its elimination.  They strive for a membership that reflects the racial/ethnic diversity of the families served by the child welfare system.  Regarding LIHA \u2013 there is not a WSPAN member who has not been negatively impacted by the lack of safe and accessible housing.  Most WSPAN members have, at one time or another, been clients of both the child welfare and housing systems.  \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Catalyst for Kids (CFK) is deeply engaged with issues related to racial justice.  Catalyst for Kids provides staffing support to the King County Coalition on Disproportionality - professionals and community leaders representing more than 40 organizations in child welfare, the courts and legal systems, public and private agencies, community members and other community stakeholders in King County, Washington serving youth and families who partner to eliminate the racial disproportionality and disparity that exists in our state\u2019s child welfare system.  CFK provides leadership in Coalition training activities, and recently sought funding from the City of Seattle Race Equity Initiative to offer community-wide training on issues related to race equity.  Coalition leadership is also actively promoting collaborative efforts to identify, be trained on, and consistently implement a race equity assessment tool.  \r\n\r\nThe Director of Catalyst for Kids, Nancy Roberts-Brown, represents the Coalition in statewide work to address race equity.  She serves as a member of the Washington State Racial Disproportionality Advisory Committee and, in that capacity, acts as a liaison between the work and strategies of the Coalition and the work and strategies of WSRDAC.  Ms. Roberts-Brown is also a member of a statewide advisory committee established to advise on statewide efforts, informed by the 2012 SHB 2536, to increase the use of Evidence Based Practices in state-funded services to children, youth and families.  As an advisory committee member, she serves as a liaison between the Coalition members and the Evidence Based Practices Institute, promoting the institute\u2019s development of strategies to ensure that the Evidence Based Practices provided to children and families of color are effectively provided by organizations that are culturally aware and who demonstrate a commitment to racial equity and the elimination of disproportionality.  \r\n\r\nThe WSPAN also has a demonstrated interest in racial equity.  Members have been trained to understand the racial disproportionality in the child welfare system, and in their statewide recruitment they strive for a membership that reflects gender, race/ethnicity, and region of the families in the child welfare system.  This spring and fall, as a new race equity training, a Roll of the Dice (www.rollofadice.org) is presented throughout the state, WSPAN members are attending at no cost to them.  WSPAN members are also active on the Washington State Racial Disproportionality Advisory Committee (WSRDAC).  Shrounda Selivanoff, an African American veteran parent who serves as the lead of the Washington State Parent Advocacy Committee, was recently appointed to WSRDAC membership and Roxanne Chinook, an American Indian veteran parent and WSPAC member, was appointed to serve as her alternate.  The more that WSPAN members have the opportunity to learn about race equity and issues related to child welfare, the more committed they become to addressing these issues in their work.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "WSPAN's policy work is directly related to the criminal justice system.  Several WSPAN members have had personal experience with this system.  As incarcerated parents with children in foster care, they were at high risk of permanently losing custody of their children simply because they were unable to access the services required of them by the child welfare system.  Many did lose permanent custody of one or more of their children.  \r\n\r\nThe reunification rate of incarcerated families is only 21%, compared with over 50% in all child welfare involved families.  Reasons for this include lack of communication and understanding between the child welfare and corrections systems, lack of incarcerated parents\u2019 access to services required for reunification, distance and policies that create barriers to visitation with their children, and timelines that require the initiation of termination of parental rights if a child has been in foster care for 12 \u2013 15 months.  In many cases, incarcerated parents simply do not know what is required of them or how to access the services and support they need in order to reunify.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue of considerable interest to WSPAN members.  The King County Parent Advocacy Committee is piloting a program with the King County Jail through which veteran parents with a history of incarceration are able to meet with parents in the jail to inform them of their rights and of the services available to them.  They support incarcerated parents being able to attend Superior Court hearings that address their child\u2019s dependency.  \r\n\r\nThis issue was also one WSPAN\u2019s three priorities during the 2013 legislative session.  Through considerable personal testimony, WSPAN members successfully advocated for the passage of HB 1284, which provides services for incarcerated parents and allows judges to have discretion in enforcing timelines related to the termination of parental rights.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "The Organization for Prostitution Survivors (OPS) is a grassroots, nonprofit organization started by survivors and allies to end the violence of prostitution. Founded in 2012, OPS creates opportunities for adult survivors in Seattle to seek supportive services to heal, and raise awareness to address the root causes of prostitution. OPS operates within three focus areas: Survivor Services, Community Education, and Men\u2019s Accountability, with all aspects centered on the mobilization and leadership of survivors. \r\n\r\nCo-founder and survivor of 15 years of prostitution, Noel Gomez recognized an acute lack of services for adult survivors of prostitution while working at YouthCare\u2019s Bridge program and facilitating the Sex Industry Workers Class for the City of Seattle. Noel collaborated with Peter Qualliotine and other survivors and allies in Seattle to establish OPS.  Co-Founder, Peter Qualliotine, has been working to change the way individuals, institutions and systems view prostitution for over 20 years. As a male ally, Peter works to interrupt the violence and harm of prostitution with Men\u2019s Accountability Programming.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, the following weekly services for women were established: drop-in, survivor-led support groups, and art workshops. Through peer mentoring and empowerment-based advocacy, OPS walks alongside survivors as they identify their needs. OPS create a non-judgmental environment where survivors can engage in critical dialogue about their experiences and begin to heal.\r\n\r\nOPS is an agent of social change; ending the harm of prostitution for future generations of prostituted people requires changing the social and cultural norms that support it and all other types of violence against women.  The Men\u2019s Accountability Program combats deeply entrenched societal norms and demand for prostitution by educating and forming male alliance networks to work collectively with women survivors.

    "narrative3": "Prostitution often involves coercion and violence on multiple levels.  The majority of survivors were sexually assaulted as children, and subsequently suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, hypertension, depression, and more.  Physically, survivors\u2019 bodies have experienced broken bones, chemical dependency, burns, traumatic brain injuries, and more.  Emotionally, chronic trauma and abuse take years from which to recover.  Survivors face constant danger to their lives\u2014the murder rate for a prostitution survivor in the U.S. is 204 for every 100,000, making it the most dangerous job in the country.  \r\n\r\nCulturally appropriate services for survivors of prostitution are a significant unmet need.  Survivors are stigmatized and victimized by societal attitudes and norms which incorrectly believe prostitution is a free choice and a victimless crime, victim-blaming survivors for the harm they have experience \u201cin the life\u201d. This misconception leads survivors to be discriminated against by law enforcement, service providers, and the general public.  \r\n\r\nOPS recognizes prostitution as a social practice and a system of men's violence against women, children, and sometimes other men.  Prostitution is supported by pervasive cultural norms including male identification of dominance and entitlement to purchase sex.  The root cause of the harm of prostitution lies within male supremacy.  Research reveals many men who do not buy sex tolerate men who do buy sex.  Men possess the power and privilege to choose to engage in prostitution, yet the victim-blaming and social stigmatization of prostituted women make exiting the life extremely difficult, a direct result of the ethics and values of male supremacy.\r\n\r\nOPS builds collective power by organizing across systems; conducting community outreach and education workshops; and by providing peer-based support to survivors and community members. OPS also trains community stakeholders and service providers who work with survivors about the harm of prostitution and provide tools to interrupt this form of gender-based violence. These efforts seek to dispel the myths and misconceptions that prevent effective engagement with adult prostitution survivors.\r\n\r\nOPS addresses the root causes of prostitution with a focus on Men\u2019s Accountability. Through Male Allyship Community Workshops, OPS encourages men to be allies to women by rejecting identification with systems of dominance and opposing the objectification of women\u2019s bodies in the commercial sex industry. The 3-day Male Allyship Train-the-Trainer Seminar builds upon the anti-oppression framework of the 3-hour Workshops, providing a highly interactive, experiential education format and in-depth reflection and dialogue about the systems of patriarchy, male sexual identity and dominance that perpetuate violence against women.  \r\n",

    "narrative5": "A primary vision of OPS is to create coordinated community responses to change the social norms around prostitution. A central value of OPS is our accountability to survivors of prostitution so that our roles of advocate and educator bring survivor experience to bear on the changes we are seeking. OPS is building a broad, effective, and unified movement through collaborative endeavors with government, non-profits, and the private sector. The following are examples:\r\n \r\nFirst, OPS creates social change through partnerships with city and county government. The OPS Director of Men's Accountability and Community Education, Peter Qualliotine, has  20 years of experience working  on the social norms that support prostitution. In 1994, Peter founded one of the first Sex Buyer's Intervention programs in the U.S. and he currently co-leads and advises the Sex Buyer Intervention Program for the City of Seattle. Due to our city and county partnerships, OPS Directors have been privileged to also advise city and county attorneys to change policies that harm prostituted persons. Attorneys have a new goal to dramatically decrease the number of charges brought against prostituted persons and increase charges brought against buyers and pimps.\r\n\r\nSecond, OPS partners with non-profit organizations like the Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC) and Goodwill. Through training, OPS builds the capacity of reputable organizations to serve survivors more effectively. \r\n\r\nThird, through collaboration with Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking and the Washington Lodging Association, OPS helped to lead the first training in the state that educated hotel managers about the harms of prostitution. Ninety-four percent of the attending managers who stated they had not provided training in the past, said that they would begin training hotel staff about the harms of prostitution and appropriate staff responses to this crime against women and children. This training changed social norms around prostitution.", 
    "narrative6": "Prostitution is a product of patriarchy, which authors sexism and racism. Historical and contemporary attitudes and practices in the United States result in the commercial sexual exploitation of Native American, African American, Asian women and Latinas. The inequality between men who buy sex and women in prostitution is compounded by the eroticism of race and ethnicity. This sexual/racist objectification of women of color is rooted in slavery and colonialism, and is common throughout the commercial sex industry. Women of color are represented in advertisements for sexual services and in pornography as desiring abuse, violation, humiliation, degradation, or as being sexually different from white women. It is common that buyers of commercial sex seek out a particular racial or ethnic \"type\", demonstrating the inseparability of sexual objectification and prostitution from racism.  \r\n\r\nIn recognition that board and staff members need to represent the diversity of OPS participants, 11% (1) of the board and 30% (3) of OPS staff members are people of color, 100% of staff are low-income, LGBTQ, or dis- or differently abled, and 11% of the board are transgender/gender-variant.  The three staff members of color are also prostitution survivors, including Noel Gomez, Co-Founder and Director of OPS.  Our organizational structure and mission includes purposeful accountability and allyship to survivors.  Survivors are recognized as the leaders of OPS. Although the OPS staff and board and primarily white, our leadership and accountability are to survivors, who are primarily women of color.\r\n\r\nOPS is currently drafting by-laws to mandate board composition be representative of the constituents, including diversity in race, ethnicity, gender identities, sexual orientations, and abilities. All types of oppression make one vulnerable to being prostituted. Prostituted people are primarily female; primarily young; disproportionately people of color, LGBTQ, dis- or differently abled, and poor or working class. OPS recognizes the importance to nurture partnerships with a variety of groups and organizations working to end all types of oppression in order to progress toward the world of OPS vision statement: \" a world free from all forms of oppression and exploitation.\"\r\n\r\nOPS holds racial justice and equity as a priority of utmost importance. Because we are currently composed of a board of primarily white allies, we are in the process of recruiting survivors and allies of color to join the board.  Established for less than one year, OPS is also actively working towards creating partnerships with organizations led by people of color. This is a primary strategy in the above project proposal: to recruit male allies from communities of color.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "Prostituted people are primarily women. In general, people of color, low-income, LGBTQ and dis or differently abled are disproportionally represented among those who are prostituted. Additionally, women of color are disproportionately represented in criminalized populations of women arrested for prostitution. \r\n\r\nHistorically, it is the prostituted woman who has been the focus of law enforcement and prosecutorial attempts to address the issue of prostitution with a ratio of 100 women arrested for every 1 \"customer\".  This is because prostitution has been viewed by the criminal justice system, as in the larger society, as an issue of the prostituted woman\u2019s morality rather than through the lens of equality, social justice and human rights. \r\n\r\nCriminalizing those who have been prostituted compounds the judgment and social stigma they experience. Prostitution arrests and convictions disenfranchise all women, but add significantly to the challenges faced by women of color and women in poverty who try to survive in other ways.  Prostitution convictions create barriers to housing, employment, and other services, forcing women to continue to be prostituted.\r\n\r\nOPS advocates for re-framing the issue of prostitution. The current climate in our area suggests an increased understanding of the victimization histories of prostituted women,.  Local law enforcement, City and County prosecutors support shifting the perspective from prosecution to protection if appropriate service referrals such as those provided by OPS survivor services exist. \r\n\r\nRegarding prostitution, criminal justice efforts should also focus on those who have substantive social and economic power to stop the harm of commercial sexual exploitation, the buyers. The law, however, cannot alone address the issue of men\u2019s entitlement to demand sexual access to the bodies of women and children. The shift in men\u2019s attitudes and in the social and cultural norms that will effect real change is the goal at the root of this proposal.\r\n",

We felt it was important for our youth to maintain a connection with the past while learning techniques that will enable them to culturally survive in the future. Goals focused on  youth and projects that would enable them to celebrate their heritage and also educate the public about the ongoing presence of the Kalapuya  who are still a vibrant part of the community. Eight years ago, we implemented a Title VII Indian Education program in local schools that  has identified Native population as 23% of the  school district. Students  in the program  support us in  a yearly Gathering and Indian Heritage Days  to bring cultural enlightenment to this very rural and racially-biased region. Over the years, we have undertaken cultural projects such as re-construction of a traditional Kalapuya long canoe,  historic photo and document collection and networking with local schools to integrate cultural classes within the  curriculum. Youth have taken part for the past eight years in a local heritage camp and also presented  community programs that include storytelling, drumming and dancing. Recently, we have consulted with ODOT in the design  of the new I-5 bridge over the Willamette River in Eugene.As we lend our support and ideas, we are able to provide enhancements that honor the Kalapuya people. Our Leadership Program has been embraced by the local school district as an example of ideal leadership techniques. The program has sponsored assemblies in five schools with topics that cover bullying, homophobia, cultural sensitivity and Indian history.  KCPA also holds regular drumming, dancing and cultural classes for  Native youth and these  are open to the public i to promote cultural appreciation in an area that has had little of such in the past",

When KCPA began promoting culture in this area, locals were so resistant that we were told not to \u201crock the boat\u201d with our ideas. Some public officials have even openly proclaimed that the local Indians are \u201c\u2026 bringing subversive ideas\u201d to our community. (a quote in a local right-wing newspaper). Small isolated communities such as those in Douglas County are slow to change, especially when cultural differences come to light. Despite this, KCPA has persisted in promoting cultural events and programs to the community and to the schools. Luckily we have very supportive school officials who work with us on the issue of intolerance. Our Indian youth are most affected by the regional attitudes and it is important that KCPA lend support and encouragement to the kids who will be taking their attitudes and ideas into the future. ",

Since the implementation of our first public programs we have not given in to the instinct to flee or quit when met with opposition. We believe that simply being here, being public and being ourselves carries the most impact. This has been difficult for our youth to understand since the initial reaction to opposition is to back down\u2026 or worse, the react in a threatening manner. In our current youth leadership program, we share with our kids the methods of peaceful, yet informative change. We have connected with the Idle No More movement and take part in bringing awareness to environmental issues both locally and other areas of the state. We also stress education as a means to feed culturally-correct information to those who have no other reliable source. Our annual Gathering and PowWow attracts local people as well as others from throughout the Northwest and providing school assemblies reaches the youth and teachers with information that is accurate and educationally solid. Many of KCPA\u2019s members work closely with schools as aides, teachers and guest speakers and the value of this presence is important to open the minds of youth and their leaders. Over the past several years, we have seen an easing of racial tension in the area, although pockets of resistance remain. We see less overt prejudice and a gradually opening of minds. ",

This is a circular process that is powered by relationships and accountability.  \r\n\r\nOur major accomplishments include: Village Gatherings that provide many opportunities for leadership development and education.  Gatherings are planned by teams of volunteers from the community responsible for planning  from conceptualization to actualization: Selecting topics; planning; logistics; facilitation; outreach; publicity and follow-up.    Gatherings honor our culture and way of knowing and communicating. They are forums for collective grieving, joy , planning, organizing and learning and they celebrate history, culture and affirm members of our community at every level.\r\n\r\nOther accomplishments include long-term and lasting relationships that build over time.  People develop their leadership and maintain a connection to the Village of Hope.  The recognition that organizing and institutional change is a long term effort, helps us to maintain focus and appreciation for the powerful relationships that sustain us in the journey.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The legacy of genocide, land acquisition, chattel slavery, manifest destiny, exclusionary immigration policies and a myriad of other issues laid the foundation for protracted poverty and oppression.  \r\n\r\nBuilding collective power:\r\nThe Village of Hope operates with the understanding that relationships have the greatest value in the African American community.  All of our work is built around the relationship and it is a fundamental aspect of building collective power.  We also understand that oppression has been devastating within our community and has impacted the way we relate with other cultural groups.  Healing is is  a critical step in building the trust necessary to build a collective.  We are constantly in a process of healing even as we do our work.  \r\n\r\nHow our work will change the root causes and power dynamics:\r\nWe know that this is a very slow process.  We will change the root causes by  engaging people in positions of institutional power with communities most impacted who have clarity about history and power and who operate with collective accountability.  We believe that as members of our community heal, and stay connected, we have the power to change not only the reality of our communities but the reality of the larger system as well.  \r\n\r\nWe have a multi-generational and multi-racial network and we use every possible opportunity to educate.  Even in the face of mass-incarceration, this work has helped us to reshape our reality.  Some of us are at a point that when we see our children, parents, brothers and sisters behind barbed wire, we are able to transcend the despair and see them as scholars and counselors and healers.  As more of us have shared this vision, the work has followed and it is becoming reality.     \r\n",

(For example, in 2012, the Village spent significant time providing outreach at Mercer Island Presbyterian Church, to develop allies in Mercer Island who could help open doors to housing and employment for people who are coming out of incarceration. When that six week educational process ended without action on the part of MIPC members, we had a frank conversation about how MIPC could be more active in tangibly supporting the Village\u2019s work. As a result, MIPC members committed to and now serve as sponsors to the Black Prisoners Caucus in Clallam Bay in partnership with and with accountability to the Black Prisoners Caucus and the Village of Hope. \r\n\r\nIn Village gatherings the feedback process is immediate.\r\n\r\nThe key question that we will be asking in all of our activities in the year ahead is: How is this activity making our network stronger? How is this activity helping individuals who are most impacted by the criminal justice system to build community with each other, and get a sense of their power?\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "The Village of Hope is part of the Undoing Racism network of organizations and employs principles of leadership development, accountability, a respect for history and culture and an understanding of the dynamics of internalized racial oppression and gate-keeping in all that we do.\r\n\r\n The Village of hope is part of the Black Prisoners Caucus Network and the Career Bridge Network.  Both are committed to holistic approaches that recognize, respect and utilize the brilliance of the people participating  to build  processes that have become a powerful force for our community.\r\n\r\nThese collaborations  have a growing capacity to increase healing, economic and educational opportunity and to positively change our political and social reality. \r\n \r\nOur role is varied.  We facilitate communication, connect efforts and above all understand when it is necessary to provide leadership and when it is necessary to take direction from others.  We help to link efforts and promote the efforts of other organizations while often playing a non-visible supporting role as we work to respectfully  infuse anti-racism principles in the work.  \r\n\r\nOur strong grounding in community gives us the credibility even with large institutions to call for greater accountability and relevance. Above all we have staying power - we are committed - we build leadership and we don't go away because we know that our children's futures are at stake.  We have supported collaborations as unlikely as the Black Prisoners Caucus and the King County Prosecuting Attorney's office working together to improve re-entry outcomes. \r\n\r\n\r\n Partners include: Seattle King County NAACP; Black Prisoner Caucus, Statewide Poverty Action Network,  Men of Color, Black Prisoners Caucus, True Vine, True Chance, White Center Community Development Association \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "We work to help our community understand racism and oppression in every phase of our work.  We use Village Gatherings as a vehicle to provide opportunities for education, dialogue and critical thinking.  \r\n\r\nIt has been stated that we use every possible opportunity to educate, here is an example:\r\n\r\nWe are partners in the Career Bridge Process which is a partnership between government and community organizations.  The process includes a standard intake form process.  We took the initiative to have a group intake night which included a process that asked each participant to identify how many programs they were currently engaged in and whether or not intake forms were required.  Nearly every participant was engaged in MULTIPLE programs and had completed MULTIPLE forms.  Most said that they had not been well served by the various programs and a significant number said that they were not helped at all in some of the programs.  They were then collectively ready to analyze and conclude that in many cases data benefits the provider more than the client.  This exercise provided a rich opportunity for dialogue and helped people to begin to question how systems operate.  At the end of the day, it was necessary to complete the forms in order to avail themselves of the training, but they participate in the process from a place of power rather than as a mere \"client\".\r\n\r\nIn the partnership with white partners in this work, whether they be the Mercer Island volunteers or educators from the university systems the dynamic of internalized racial superiority is an ever-present challenge.  The challenge is magnified because of the power dynamic of working in the prisons.  This reality necessitates that we remain vigilant and willing to be both vulnerable and honest.  This is a very difficult balance and is often draining for all concerned.  Grounding in principles and understanding and knowing history and being willing to constantly build our knowledge and understanding of internalized oppression is fundamental to maintaining the relationship.  It is an ever present tension.\r\n\r\nAs we address the systemic injustices, those of us who are most impacted because we are caught in the systems often struggle with one another because of the pressures that we feel.  It becomes very easy to blame one another for the conditions that we find ourselves in.  This is the most difficult tension to contend with and it requires the  most understanding and work.  It is the struggle that our families face, it's the struggle that sits on top of the strain of being unemployed and without housing.  It makes systemic struggle just that much more difficult, however the relationship is the rope that helps to lift the oppression.",

The program uses classes that address racism, sexism, meanness (use of force in problem solving) and meaninglessness (spectator-ism), and how the status quo imposes consumerist, individualist values & behavior that distort our sharing cultures and our ways of being collective (building collective power).

ICL Democracy Education curriculum puts all of us (collectively), in relationship with one another so that we develop conduct, character and consciousness required for sustained social change. Our pedagogy supports developing collectivist worldview through liberatory teaching and learning, shared cultural work, and mobilizing. August 1-6, the Quinault Indian Nation hosts Tribal Journeys, honoring the arrival at the QIN of canoe pullers and 10,000 guests of 60 tribes, for traditional meals, song, stories, and protocol. The QIN have invited ICL to join as hosts. 25 intergenerational, inter-racial ICL members will travel 280 miles in two vans and 18 foot equipment truck, camp out and host. June and July we are mobilizing intergenerational circles to bake 500 pies for the give-away and traditional dinner. We will have structured writing sessions every day, and oral history sessions with elders. ICL pedagogy promotes non-corporate, communitarian worldview in relationship to democracy, and values that promote the common-good: interdependence, other-interestedness, mutuality, and ecology. Tribal Journeys gives opportunity to reflect and learn indigenous, collectivist, non-dominant values and worldview. The cultural renaissance under sovereignty, and sharing with elders, youth and community tribal members, will be our teacher. We will all learn together, then share our learning with others: 1. We will create a chap book with the writings and photos. Copies will become part of our curriculum for organizing work. 2. We host three community dialogues in September, October and November, called Community Conversations: Culture, Worldview, and Democracy. We will present poems, stories and photos, followed by community conversation. This fundamental shift in worldview must come, in our nation, if humanity and Mother Earth are to survive. This project works to advance youth voice, action and training in this alternative collectivist worldview, in schools, communities and movement efforts.",

    "narrative4": "Democracy Education is a teaching and learning approach to develop personal and group power that recognizes that the worldview in our schools and educational settings (and other institutions) is primarily based on individualism, competition , privilege, and greed.  Most cultures, low-income and rural communities have collectivist value orientations that respect interdependency, mutuality, inclusion and ecological sustainability. Teaching and learning these common-good values and worldview develops personal power, voice, group power and the ability to bring change into being. This year we plan to advance our Democracy Education curriculum, by launching a new website, creating an on-line certification program, publishing three chapbooks, and focusing our mobilizing and organizing work on getting this pedagogy out to schools, community organizations, tribes and labor organizing efforts.  We will organize and mobilize to bake 500 pies for Tribal Journeys, then be a part of hosting and we will drive to Washington DC for a 50th year recognition of the march on Washington.  We will study and do press conferences highlighting that the \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Speech was actually a \u201cThey Wrote Us A Bad Check\u201d speech.  We will ask:  what is the Civil Rights message for today? And gather community voices to that question. In our program year, we will carry out community conversations, organize and mobilize to confront injustices in our schools and develop youth voice in intergenerational roles.\r\nWe have just recently completed a longitudinal study on 15 years of programming at ICL and the MLKJFC.  We have data that points what changes in lives when an other-interested, community change paradigm that uplifts the common-good is adopted by individuals, and with-in organizations.  Our outreach this year will access these outcomes to raise consciousness and confront deep inequities, and  race and class divides in schools, community and society. \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "The Martin Luther King Jr Freedom Center and Quinault Indian Nation: While ICL and the QIN have worked and struggled closely together for years, this is the first time in 20 years they are hosts of the Journeys, and the first time we have ever had such an opportunity. We have had Quinault Board representation since our founding, and have shared in scores of intergenerational, cultural leadership exchanges between the tribal, urban and rural communities where we work, and also going together to other places and nations\u2014like Nicaragua, Oakland, or on Vision Quests. Our work in Oakland is with the MLKFreedom Center.  We share staff, trainings and weekly study circles (on-line). This past year youth from Oakland and Kent spent time in Quinault making a 32 foot traditional cedar canoe. The various gatherings focus on advancing Democracy Education and on staff training and development.  Our role includes training youth and adult organizers, teachers and cultural workers, and developing self-change and social-change leadership and organizations.\r\nTribal Journeys will have day and night, 24/7 protocol, song and dance. That\u2019s not easy. What the tribes are doing is important: no corporate sponsors, no fees, all meals are shared, everyone participates. Pulling the canoes, and working at Tribal Journeys requires dedication, sacrifice, and you have to be clean to do it. In general we know we don\u2019t fight for our cultural identities. That means we ignore ancestors, our own carvers, carpenters, artists, singers and dancers. And we take on conduct of oppression, how we dress, and how we spend our free time. We aren\u2019t seriously studying our own history, or our own emancipation. So we accept the myths and deformations of the status quo. This summer experience creating and participating, strengthens our curriculum which promotes collectivist, over individualist, values and worldview.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "ICL is one of the most honest and transparent organizations I have ever been a part of, and really committed to youth and community integration and roles. ICL realizes that in the US, opportunity is not equal and is unjust therefore we struggle to see what makes inequities, and create new structures, and new ways of relating. We grow leadership for the organization from within each of us. We currently have a diverse board (3 Latinos, 1 African American and three Caucasian) and our organizers are all of color, and all former students\u2014African American, Mexican, Sudanese and Cuban. Overall our staff is more than half people of color, and if you include our staff in Oakland, we have only 10% white folks. I am a former student, and now a steel worker, and an ICL Board Member, my family is Latino and Hidatsa. Staff and key volunteers participate in a weekly study sessions. We address community and organizational needs, identify purposes for activities and actions, develop new leadership to take on lead roles, and always evaluate. The content of our curriculum is mostly poetry, poems and speeches written by authors mostly all of color, with social problem solving themes. One thing this workshop does and I think is key, is it allows the student to read his/her own lines and outlook to others, and then receive feedback from them on how well the student presented their lines. This process allows the student to jump out of their comfort zone or bubble and get into a new way of being, and all participants are willing to learn from each other and also respect one another, in a meaningful role, and in a constant improvement pattern. In this way, students of color who often don't have the \"right answer\" are able to share their cultural and intuitive knowledge and experience, and be the experts.  This class really creates all voices to get out in the social space, in the air, which creates group power. For hundreds of years racism has been the destruction of our lives and it continues to be, we wake up in the morning and we are indebted to more than half the world-- our clothes we wear and the tools we use, the paper we write on, and the shoes that support us are all made by different workers from different parts of the world, yet while all this is happening the communities of color are all being destroyed by the lack of power in their community and those that make decisions effecting them. We build collective power by recruiting students that are wanting to change things, and be a part of something bigger than themselves.",

    "narrative3": "Within the outlined course, the module on Immigrant justice is linked to Article #6 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \"Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.\"  The intent of the module is to both provide high quality professional development for educators and training materials for the UVI community at-large to foster allies who recognize that immigrants are integral to Idaho\u2019s economy as workers and taxpayers; who recognize that immigrants are not the \"other\" but integral members of our communities; and who recognize that recognition before the is a human rights belonging to all members of the family.  Specifically, the module will illustrate the following statistics:\r\n- Immigrants comprised 7.5% of the state\u2019s workforce in 2011 (or 57,247 workers), according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\r\n- Unauthorized immigrants comprised roughly 2.8% of the state\u2019s workforce (or 20,000 workers) in 2010 , according to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center.\r\n- If all unauthorized immigrants were removed from Idaho, the state would lose $428.8 million in economic activity, $190.4 million in gross state product, and approximately 3,060 jobs , even accounting for adequate market adjustment time, according to a report by the Perryman Group .\r\n- Immigrants, Latinos, and Asians account for growing shares of the economy and population in Idaho. Immigrants (the foreign-born) make up 6% of the state\u2019s population, and one-third of them are naturalized U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote. \u201cNew Americans\u201d\u2014immigrants and the children of immigrants\u2014account for 4.2% of registered voters in the state. Immigrants are not only integral to the state\u2019s economy as workers, but also account for billions of dollars in tax revenue and consumer purchasing power. Moreover, Latinos and Asians (both foreign-born and native-born) wield $4.1 billion in consumer purchasing power, and the businesses they own had sales and receipts of $939.5 million and employed more than 7,300 people at last count. At a time when the economy is still recovering, Idaho can ill-afford to alienate such an important component of its labor force, tax base, and business community.\r\n-Immigrants and their children are growing shares of Idaho\u2019s population and electorate. \r\n\r\nThe Center\u2019s goal through educational outreach is to engage the hearts and minds of people across the state and thereby effect change in the attitude of Idahoans. This attitudinal transformation is systemic in scale. Idaho\u2019s educators are a core constituency for the Center because inspiring young minds with the power, necessity and inclusiveness of a human rights perspective is critical to achieving greater community empowerment as well as sustainable, positive change.  Working in partnership with UVI, we are guaranteeing resource development and production to best meet the needs of multiple audiences.",

    "narrative4": "Idaho\u2019s rural and conservative landscape frequently leaves us vulnerable to human rights attacks and wedge issues. The Center has a rich legacy of collaborative human rights work in the face of extremist attacks. Through our experience in education outreach in Idaho, we\u2019ve learned that a human rights framework is the most effective tool for articulating and implementing a vision of long-term positive social change. Our programming and services blend education, leadership development strategies and advocacy initiatives to expand a network of Idaho leaders and groups to reshape public debate in a way that brings our core human rights value system to the forefront. United Vision for Idaho will be helping to develop and using the modules as a new and innovative tool for grassroots organizing and leadership development and community trainings.  The Idaho Human Rights Education Center will be using the modules for educator professional development and university graduate student programming. \r\nSpecific to this request for funding, the partners have outlined a six-month timeline for module research, development, production, and pilot. Our evaluation procedures will include both qualitative and quantitative measurements for overall project implementation, to commence with grant receipt and continue throughout the year\u2019s duration: (1) How many people accessed the Center\u2019s resources and in what format? (2) Were we effective in reaching our target audiences? (3) Were we effective demographically? (4) What was the response from those who received resources or participated in a program, public presentation, or other Center / UVI event? (5) Did the resources encourage them to question their own behavior or belief system? If so, how? If not, why?  \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "We seek to collaborate with other groups and organizations whenever possible. In fact, one of the Center\u2019s greatest strengths is our ability to articulate effectively a human rights analysis as a point of unity that can frame and link issues and campaigns which address inequality among varied organizations and constituencies. To this end, we work closely with a number of regional advocacy and community organizations, our professional networks include: the Association of Idaho Cities\u2019 Human Rights Campaign, Coeur d\u2019Alene\u2019s Human Rights Education Institute, Boise State University Women\u2019s and Cultural Centers, University of Idaho Women\u2019s and Cultural Centers, Idaho Women\u2019s Network, United Vision for Idaho, Your Family, Friends and Neighbors, Intermountain Fair Housing Council, Idaho Black History Museum, Idaho Inclusiveness Coalition, Women of Color Alliance, Agency for New Americans, Idaho Hispanic Caucus, Mujeres Unidas de Idaho, Idaho Latino Vote, Interfaith Alliance, Western States Center and Centro de Communidad y Justicia. The Center recognizes that collaborative partnerships are a critical agent of social change and we can increase our base as well as extend the reach of our mission because of these collaborations. The Center recognizes that collaborative partnerships are a critical agent of social change and our base and mission are enhanced because of these strategic partnerships. We will certainly reach out to the partner agencies listed above to identify participants for professional development and/or module training.", 
    "narrative6": "The Center\u2019s staff is small, consisting of an executive director, an administrative assistant, a development director, and three part-time education program specialists. While the Center has historically been and remains a primarily white anti-oppression allied organization, we recruit our volunteers and participants for our programs from diverse constituencies. Likewise, as a member of United Vision for Idaho, we interact, collaborate and cooperate with the wide spectrum of social justice organizations throughout the state.  As such, we offer support to under-represented communities and seek to identify and develop leaders from these groups. Again, the Center can most effectively serve the cause of systemic anti-oppression work through allied advocacy. For example, the Idaho Community Action Network (ICAN), a local direct action community organization led by its primarily low-income membership and Latino staff, is Idaho\u2019s forerunner in immigrant justice and reform. Immigrant justice is a priority to the Center, but we recognize that ICAN is a more suitable the leader in this movement. The Center is a key ally to the Idaho Community Action Network in their organizing efforts around farmworker and immigrant justice, including offering legislative support, committee testimony, authoring guest editorials, speaking at rallies, attending regional summits for allies and hosting press conferences at the Memorial. In addition, the Center actively seeks to assist specific constituencies when a need is identified. The \u201cOrientation Guide for Immigrants to Idaho,\u201d is an example of programming we developed based on needs identified by allied constituencies.  .  Our mission and expertise is grounded in the value of education and the impact of effective teaching and learning opportunities. ",

Our tribal council are all direct descendants of the last two Clatsop Chiefs, Tostom and Coboway. We have one motive, and one motive only in seeking restoration, and that is to honor our ancestors who lived and died to keep our culture alive.  We signed a treaty presented to us by the US Government in 1851, which was not ratified.  In 1954, the Western Oregon Termination Act, terminated the rights of Western Oregon Tribes, and we were included in the list of those tribes.  Since then seven tribes have been restored by Congress, and now our tribes seeks to restore our status of a Federally recognized tribe.  When our homelands were taken over, we gathered in a small town, subjected to atrocities of white settlers, then later the kukluxklan.  People still build their homes over the graves of our ancestors to this day.  We are not \"eligible\" to have our relics returned to us because we are not federally recognized.  Our Major accomplishment is that we are still alive, organized now, still fighting for justice.  Other accomplishments are that we continue to work on cultural preservation  We have a cedar canoe and travel in the Canoe Journeys of the northwest, sharing our tribal songs, dances and culture.

Without any rights, settlers were given free reign over our homelands.  We were forced to either move away, or move inward to a small town where even there we suffered humiliating racist acts.   We signed a treaty, which was not ratified.  Even though we were not given a treaty, we were again named in a congressional act which officially terminated us in 1954.  At this point we have no land we call our own.  Even our ancestral relics, and remains of our ancestors located in the National Archives will not be returned to us because we have no rights.  We can not even protect our grave sites where people build their homes.  The only way to protect ourselves is to gain rights as a restored tribe.  We have organized ourselves as a collective group meeting officially monthly, but more often than that to achieve restoration.  With no money, we have been able to make contact and gain the support of an ex-congress woman that assisted the other tribes gain restoration.  We have gathered information on how to accomplish our goal, created a commission to work on all the details required by the Congress to establish our restoration.  We have also established a relationship with our current congressional representative and will be asking her to present a bill in the current congress.  We have created relationships with other tribes and non-Indian local governments and organizations who now support our endeavor.  When our Bill is approved, we will have been restored, establishing our sovereign rights as Indian people in the United States of America.  With these rights, we will have the right to bring our ancestors home from the National Archives, and build a formal Government, which will have the status of a Tribal Government to US Government Relationship.  We will be able to build and protect our futures as Native people.",

We see these types of institutions as the cornerstone of a democratic society that have the potential to build strong families, healthy communities and a just world.  In order to achieve this, they have to be organized differently.  We work to build an organizing and relational culture to engage people in a meaningful way to change our neighborhoods, city and state.   We strive to hold both public and private power holders responsible for their public responsibilities, as well as initiate actions of our own to solve community and economic problems. \r\n\r\nThe Spokane Alliance has an eleven year track record.  Our organization started out of organizing for a much needed stoplight on a busy street right next to an elementary school.  With Alliance\u2019s training in power analysis, relationship building, research/action, and with involvement by other institutions the PTA won an unusual unanimous vote at the city council and this success helped develop the energy to continue organizing and develop the Alliance.   A few of our major accomplishments include; organizing to pass a $1.1 billion State Jobs Bill that created over 18,000 jobs in Washington State during the 2011-2012 legislative session, created non-profit SustainableWorks to bring carbon cuts, apprenticeship opportunities and energy cost cuts to families and small businesses in greater Spokane, the Spokane Alliance partnered with Spokane Public Schools to develop asbestos removal standards in 2009, and we offset service cutbacks by 40% to Spokane public transit in 2005.

    "narrative3": "The Spokane Alliance is a multi-issue organization.  The issues we work on come from within our institutions, from the concerns of the people.  We act on big problems (such as quality of life) by breaking it down into issues that can be addressed into clear, concrete and winnable issues.  For example, medical students are working on health equity and are focused on bringing healthier, local food inside Spokane hospitals, our jobs team is organizing to leverage public project resources to increase the quality of job that will be created by paying a living wage, hiring a local workforce, providing full family health care and using local materials.   We listen to what is needed, find like-minded people to work with us for change, and engage leaders who can help us achieve our goals.  We don\u2019t organize for justice and social change FOR people.  We organize for justice and social change WITH people.  \r\n\r\nThe root causes of each of the issues we work on is different from issue to issue, but many issues stem from two places; not having everyday people involved in organizing for their community along with too much power in too few peoples hands.  The Spokane Alliance organizes to create relational power, power with.  This type of power is shared, is infinite and the more we have the bigger success we'll achieve.  We build our collective power through organizing people and organizing money, developing a focus and being consistent.  Our main tool to build our power is the relational meeting.  Each of our meetings starts with meeting someone you don't know well and focusing the conversation around each others drive, interests and where that comes from.  Picture construction workers meeting with medical students, pastors with teachers, lay people with grocery store workers, fire fighters with garbage men.  We are successful because we build trust, break down stereotypes and develop the ties needed to allow us to be creative and go into action with a broad base of people and strong foundation. \r\n\r\nOur work will change and challenge the root causes and underlying power dynamics of the issues we work on.  We do this by building the broadest base we can, of firefighters, city workers, United Methodists, students, teachers, parents, iron workers, Unitarians, catholics, grocery store workers, nurses and others.  This group is a major representation of our city population.  The more we can diversify and broaden our base to farmers, other faith institutions, more universities and businesses we'll be even stronger.  We already have recognition from the Mayor, council and county commissioners.  They are listening.  We are developing a vision for the city and growing our base to have the power to act on it.  ",

To be more specific, a goal of ours is to have the council candidates adopt and champion our agenda that's currently being created by our members to Restore Spokane's Future, another goal is to hold developers accountable to creating quality jobs and to strengthen our leadership base so we can do statewide work next year and be successful with new leaders and increasing energy.  \r\n\r\nWe hold a verbal evaluation after every action we take.  We do this to have a group assessment of the meeting/action and be clear on where we should go next.  This act is built into our organizing cycle, our leaders expect it.

We're continuing to have the course as another elective for this coming school year, together we're recruiting new students and interested faculty.  Health Care is one of the top employers in Spokane.  To be organizing with soon to be medical providers we're increasing the base of where our constituency works and lives.

The Alliance organized mental health parity legislation to require treatment be the same for mental illness as it is for physical.  The Alliance is in a year long process working with other non-profits and the Spokane Public School System to bring a school-based health clinic at Rogers High School which is one of the most diverse and low income schools in our city.

    "narrative1": "Mission \r\nWAPI Community Services is a non-profit agency serving Asian Pacific Islander youth and all youth of color, ages 10-20, in the greater Seattle area. WAPI currently serves youth in the ID/Chinatown region and in the south-end neighborhoods comprised of Mt. Baker, Rainier Beach, Beacon Hill, and Columbia City. Our mission is to provide and advocate for culturally competent and age-appropriate prevention and substance abuse treatment services for Asian Pacific Islander Youth and all Youth of Color. Our vision is to create an environment for children, youth, adults, families and communities that is healthy and substance abuse free.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nIn 1990, concerned individuals in the Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and the King County's Division of Alcohol and Substance Abuse originally founded the organization. These groups were concerned about issues of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use in the AAPI community. The organization was originally named Washington Asian Pacific Islander Families Against Substance Abuse (WAPIFASA). It became a nonprofit in 1993 and received its 501(c)3 status in 1994. In 1996, it became a Washington state certified chemical dependency provider. In 2005, WAPIFASA expanded its mission to serve all youth of color and in 2008, changed its name to Washington Asian Pacific Islander (WAPI) Community Services. \r\n\r\nMajor Accomplishments\r\n2006-received funding from City of Seattle YouthArts to start our Katalyst Music and Urban Arts program  \r\n2007-received prevention funding from King County Mental Health Chemical Abuse Dependency Division\r\n2010-through a partnership with Southeast Youth and Families (SEYFS) moved to our current location in Columbia City, tripling size and capacity to serve more youth.\r\n2010-Created Street Scholars Curriculum, blending social justice education, and cultural identity building.  \r\n2012-Maintained a 95% retention rate (at the 90 day mark) for our target population (low income youth of color) in our drug counseling program.

    "narrative3": "Identifying the need\r\nWAPI discovered that many youth lacked the knowledge of the environmental factors, such as poverty and oppression that attribute to substance abuse. Additionally, many youth internalize these issues and accept the status quo as part of their reality. This led the organization to modify the prevention program to address the root cause of substance abuse and to find appropriate interventions that elicit a systemic change. Prevention program has been operating based upon this framework for six years and would like to make it youth-led completely. \r\n\r\nRoot cause of substance abuse\r\nSubstance abuse among youth of color is an unhealthy behavior/coping mechanism caused by psychosocial stress. This stress comes from being oppressed: conditions such as generational poverty, lack of safe and drug-free housing, and domestic violence are risk factors attributing to substance abuse. These conditions happen due to: lack of quality education, productive resources, and social capital. Racial-ethnic and class discrimination, most importantly, affect access to these factors. \r\n\r\nBuilding collective power\r\nCurrently, WAPI builds collective power with its prevention program. The following are the high- level components of the prevention program: (1) knowledge about social-justice, (2) empowerment-based facilitation, and (3) identify development. With all these factors combined, and shifting the prevention program to be completely youth-led, WAPI ensures youth to develop their own agency to mobilize and organize to break the cycle of substance abuse.\r\n\r\nThere are two main components of the prevention program: (1) Street Scholars curriculum and (2) Katalyst program. Street Scholars is a leadership development and drug prevention curriculum, designed to teach environmental factors of substance abuse and to raise youth's awareness in social- justice. WAPI relied on adult allies to teach this curriculum in the past, but plans to have the prevention program graduates (youth) to teach this curriculum to other youth. This, in turn, will start the mobilization process. It is a slow start, but ultimately, WAPI hopes to see many youth teaching other youth to have a strong social-justice framework, and to build a \u201cStreet Scholars Alumni Network.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Katalyst music and arts program is a youth-driven program that teaches hip-hop and urban arts as a mode of creative expression. The goal of this program is to offer classes and skills in areas that interest the youth. It is about meeting the youth where they are at. Through the Katalyst program, WAPI has been a physical hub of creative youth in the south-end; youth from organizations such as YouthSpeaks, Seattle Young People's Project (SYPP), Youth Media Institute (YMI), and Youngstown gather at WAPI to build relationships with other youth and to build a community.",

    "narrative4": "Goals/Strategies\r\nWAPI's goal is to modify the current prevention program (youth driven) to be completely youth-led. WAPI plans to achieve this goal by (1) training youth to teach Street Scholars to other youth and building a \u201cStreet Scholars Alumni Network\u201d, (2) implementing Street Scholars curriculum to all of WAPI's programs, which includes substance abuse treatment counseling, Katalyst program, and orientation for drop-in youth, (3) continuing to keep the Katalyst program youth-led, and finally (4) developing a strong partnership with SYPP for political specific mobilization and issue-based organizing purposes by creating the \u201cYouth Organizers Pipeline.\u201d\r\n\r\nWAPI would like to invite Social Justice Fund Northwest to be one of the first funders to build this mobilization process. As mentioned in the prior section, WAPI's strongest assets are its strong presence in the south-end neighborhood and its capacity to culturally engage many youth of color. The prevention program's infrastructure has strengthened over the last six years, and we believe it is timely that it makes the transition for the coming year.\r\n\r\nHow will we assess?\r\nWAPI staff will assess through pre/post evaluations that gauge the knowledge and skill level of our youth. The assessment and the evaluation piece would have to involve the youth at WAPI as well. By the end of the upcoming year, a successful outcome of this initiative is to have youth of WAPI lead the prevention program entirely, with adult allies facilitating when/if needed. Another critical component is to assess how many youth are providing the Street Scholars training to other youth and to what capacity. Lastly, it is critical to assess how many youth are moving forward with the SYPP partnership and joining the \u201cYouth Organizers Pipeline.\u201d WAPI adult allies and the youth work together in creating an evaluation tool that assesses knowledge and efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Current Partnerships\r\nWAPI understands the power of linking with other organizations rather than ranking. WAPI has worked with SYPP, YouthSpeaks, Filipino/a Seattle Teens and Resources (FilStar), Youngstown, and Asian Pacific Islander Community Leadership Foundation (ACLF). WAPI has situated itself as the safe space where current youth leaders such as Henry Luke of Youth Speaks and Anelise Moon of SYPP thrived and expressed themselves creatively through art and music over many years. WAPI's physical space also continues to be Youth Speak's open mic nights 1st sunday of every month. The Katalyst program in particular is intimately linked with Youth Speaks. The youth of WAPI and Katalyst continue to work together to fine-tune and cultivate their critical thinking skills through the art of poetry.\r\n\r\nCollaboration with SYPP\r\nAs WAPI makes the transition to shifting the prevention program to be youth-led, a partnership with SYPP would be a critical and innovative strategy. SYPP has programs such as YO 2.0 camp that teaches movement work, social-justice analysis, and basic organizing skills. As WAPI youth learn the Street Scholars curriculum and become part of the \u201cStreet Scholars Alumni network\u201d, we intend to expose WAPI youth to programs at SYPP. Long term goal would be to partner with SYPP permanently to create a pipeline of socially conscious youth, where WAPI serves as the \u201cportal\u201d for local youth in and out of the justice system (\u201cYouth Organizers Pipeline). \r\n\r\nLastly, because of the Katalyst program and its cultural appeal to the youth, WAPI youth are from different gangs, public schools, on probation, from Juvenile Hall or in Juvenile Drug Court, and other sources. Because of this, Katalyst youth have already started to build a community that crosses neighborhoods, schools, and other societal divisions, establishing a network or a coalition that is their own.", 
    "narrative6": "WAPI works towards racial justice by providing culturally-appropriate substance abuse treatment and prevention programs. To achieve this, WAPI staffs all people of color; this is in the hopes of providing culturally-appropriate service delivery for the diverse youth that WAPI serves. The Katalyst hip-hop and urban arts program is another strategy to engage our culturally-diverse youth. \r\n\r\nStreet Scholars\r\nMost importantly, WAPI addresses these forms of oppression through the Street Scholars curriculum. The Street Scholars curriculum is influenced by critical pedagogy and critical race theory. Critical pedagogy challenges instructors to question dominant ideas and concepts while also engaging a learner's experiences and knowledge of injustices, such as social marginalization and oppression. Critical race theory encourages a learner to name their own identity and challenges them to seek other ways in which they can succeed beyond the marginalized communities in which they exist. By combing critical pedagogy and critical race theory, Street Scholars curriculum is designed for youth to address their intersectionality between class and race. It is at this point that youth can address social, educational, political, and economic concerns of race. Therefore, Street Scholars curriculum teaches concepts of economic and race structure in the U.S. society to explain why marginalization and internalized oppression can happen to certain communities. By taking the anti-racist youth development approach, WAPI is also able to present opportunities for youth to address issues regarding themselves and their communities; through these difficult discussions, the youth understand the importance in taking the leadership role to be the change agents in their communities.

The cyclical nature of this issue illustrates the even greater disproportionality in the juvenile justice system. Youth of color are more likely to be expelled or suspended from schools; they are also over-represented in the justice system. WAPI stays accountable to these communities by defining substance abuse as a systemic issue, not an individual issue. WAPI understands the nature of systemic change-- paradigm shift happens with mobilization and organization, directly led by the youth. Therefore, WAPI's prevention programs-- Katalyst and Street Scholars train youth to be positive, substance-free organizers/leaders in their communities.

This is not the issue according to our local research, yet our incarceration habits seem to be inflating  the number of beds that are occupied in the county jail.  Our citizens are being excessively harassed with minor offenses, spend excessive amounts of time in jail, it appears that we are building a poverty funnel to prison, and the Sheriff and administration wants to expand their scope. \r\n\r\nBased on our field and statistical research we see many reasons not to increase the beds dramatically, and we feel instead that we need to invest instead into re-education, literacy, intervention solutions and more.  Right now Whatcom County spends between 60-70% of our county budget on law and justice - and this is not sustainable. . \r\n\r\nOur Sheriff is pushing an agenda to enlarge our jail from a recommended 500 bed jail - to 800, on a large physical compound out of the central civic core and would put undue hardship on inmates and their families. \r\n\r\nOur clientele has become dramatically discriminated against and feels completely disenfranchised. \r\nWe recognize after years of work that our clients are considered unsavory or distasteful, so getting funding is a challenge. \r\n\r\nWe have been collectively data gathering for 2 years to build a solid relationship based with community organizations, listening to how our clients affect them, their families, and our taxpayers.  We've held conferences, panels, discussions, interviewed hundreds of people to listen to challenges and gather ideas, build coalitions and a collective power base from which to launch our campaign for change.  We've done the work to fully understand the systemic nature of the problem, and it is rooted in the false belief that people are bad, that they are \"criminals\", that they don't deserve any help - yet our denial of the problems that this causes our community - is actually hemorrhaging our economy.  Our corrections system has effectively become a criminal generating system - and it is not working for our local community, nor for our nation. It is truly a source of decay for our civic society.  Some believe this is bankrupting us.\r\n \r\nWe are building relationships with many organizations and strengthening our coalition with people like the Animals as Natural Therapy, ReUse Works, Computers for Kids, Opportunity Council, the Homeless Coalition, Critical Junctures institute, Whatcom Alliance for Healthcare Access.  \r\nWhile building relationships, doing reentry education for citizen groups, before councils, prison and social change conferences, at Martin Luther King Conference, schools and universities, we have generated interest in our vision for ReStoreALife Center and Restorative Community that deals with the root cause.",

Build a project team of business, social, civic, agricultural, healthcare and law-enforcement segments in our community with the express purpose to create a vision for how we can stop the accelerating growth of the punitive justice and poverty growth industry in Whatcom County by instead proposing a realistic alternative that we can fund and implement in 2014.  \r\n\r\n2)  We have already done much of the research and have a vision, and now we are currently embarked on building a business plan.  In this plan, we are in the process of enrolling our community leaders in reducing the size and nature of the recently  proposed Whatcom County Jail - and instead diverting a large segment of their inmates into restorative justice alternatives, into a DeLancey Street style of reentry and recovery. \r\n\r\n3)  Once our business plan is in place, we will be taking the plan to market to get funded, and will be looking to build a coalition and cooperative of many organizations to help us initiate, then expand the plan to include dozens of other agencies in the process.  \r\n\r\nIn 2012 already, we have done much statistical research, we've interviewed hundreds of folks about their problems, our proposed solutions and more.  We've researched the return on investment and success rates of many alternative programs, and selected various solutions to add to the conference process. We sponsored several community meetings to invite participation, and have created the Restorative Community project team and we are now embarked on a process to develop a measurable and specific plan and get it built in time to cause the new jail to downsize.  \r\n\r\n",

Encouragement for jobs well done.\r\nOur Restorative Communities vision will allow our underserved population to be supported and encouraged for success instead of being jailed or imprisoned - again.\r\n\r\n~ In 2011 we approached Western Washington University  to learn how we might work with interns from their Service Learning department. Fall of 2012 we were connected with Dr. Tara Perry and her Communication class.  We have worked with Dr. Perry and her students every quarter for the past year, totaling 22 students.  \r\nWe identified education of the public as one of the most needed aspects of our programs.  Each of the 5 classes working with us has contributed to this end.  We now have a 10 minute YouTube video with 6 more hours of footage, a new logo, brochure, website, Twitter account, social media Houtesuite knowledge, and hundreds of hours of invaluable research, all performed by these interns.  \r\nOne of our intern projects was to collect and update public information on agencies to update the 4people.org website.\r\nWe have had the opportunity to educate hundreds of students, inspire some to change their course of study, and effect the attitudes and belief systems of countless more.  \r\n ",

This is not the issue according to our local research, yet our incarceration habits seem to be inflating  the number of beds that are occupied in the county jail.  Our citizens are being excessively harassed with minor offenses, spend excessive amounts of time in jail, it appears that we are building a poverty funnel to prison, and the Sheriff and administration wants to expand their scope. \r\n\r\nBased on our field and statistical research we see many reasons not to increase the beds dramatically, and we feel instead that we need to invest instead into re-education, literacy, intervention solutions and more.  Right now Whatcom County spends between 60-70% of our county budget on law and justice - and this is not sustainable. . \r\n\r\nOur Sheriff is pushing an agenda to enlarge our jail from a recommended 500 bed jail - to 800, on a large physical compound out of the central civic core and would put undue hardship on inmates and their families. \r\n\r\nOur clientele has become dramatically discriminated against and feels completely disenfranchised. \r\nWe recognize after years of work that our clients are considered unsavory or distasteful, so getting funding is a challenge. \r\n\r\nWe have been collectively data gathering for 2 years to build a solid relationship based with community organizations, listening to how our clients affect them, their families, and our taxpayers.  We've held conferences, panels, discussions, interviewed hundreds of people to listen to challenges and gather ideas, build coalitions and a collective power base from which to launch our campaign for change.  We've done the work to fully understand the systemic nature of the problem, and it is rooted in the false belief that people are bad, that they are \"criminals\", that they don't deserve any help - yet our denial of the problems that this causes our community - is actually hemorrhaging our economy.  Our corrections system has effectively become a criminal generating system - and it is not working for our local community, nor for our nation. It is truly a source of decay for our civic society.  Some believe this is bankrupting us.\r\n \r\nWe are building relationships with many organizations and strengthening our coalition with people like the Animals as Natural Therapy, ReUse Works, Computers for Kids, Opportunity Council, the Homeless Coalition, Critical Junctures institute, Whatcom Alliance for Healthcare Access.  \r\nWhile building relationships, doing reentry education for citizen groups, before councils, prison and social change conferences, at Martin Luther King Conference, schools and universities, we have generated interest in our vision for ReStoreALife Center and Restorative Community that deals with the root cause.",

    "narrative1": "Mission \r\n\r\nThe CLI was founded to prepare leaders with the political consciousness and capacity needed to lead and support social justice work. Our focus is on developing more deeply and methodically the commitment and the skills of grassroots Latino leaders serving and organizing the Northern and Mid-Willamette Valley Latino community.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n \r\nThe CLI came to life as an independent non-profit on July 13, 2011. That day, nine leaders of community-based, Latino-led social change organizations in the Mid-Willamette Valley\u2014the \u201cCAPACES network\u201d\u2014signed and filed the articles of incorporation.  The nine organizations are PCUN, Farmworker Housing Development Corporation (FHDC), CAUSA, Mano a Mano Family Center, Latinos Unidos Siempre, Voz Hispana Causa Chavista, Mujeres Luchadoras Progresistas, Salem-Keizer Coalition for Equality, and Oregon Farm Worker Ministry.  \r\n\r\nThe CAPACES network was created in 2003 to unite the nine organizations, promote peer relationships and foster mutual identification as a movement.  We organized and conducted some 200 meetings and gatherings, large and small\u2014cross training on the practicalities of leadership and the big ideas of social change.  In 2008, we concluded that we must accelerate and deepen the leadership development.  We resolved to take a quantum leap forward:   fund, build and staff the CAPACES Leadership Institute a place where social change leaders of today and tomorrow engage the big ideas and values that define our movement and where they gain the skills to apply them.  \r\n\r\nAccomplishments\r\n\r\nOur most significant accomplishments to date include:  (1) launching the CAPACES 101 curriculum which is the core of the organization\u2019s programs (2) training the key participants (through CAPACES 101) that led a grassroots campaign in Woodburn to pass a city ordinance to publicly display murals, (3) Raising over $750,000 and involving 1,300 volunteers to build a debt-free, \u201cPassivhaus\u201d energy-saving facility, the first of its kind west of the Mississippi. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "Problems/needs/issues\r\n\r\nIn Oregon\u2019s Mid-Willamette valley, Latino farmworker\u2019s and immigrants are underrepresented in decision-making bodies (school board, city council, and other government bodies) that determine the fate of the community. This despite the fact that Latinos make up the majority of the population in Woodburn, Oregon, and other segments of the Valley the CLI operates in. \r\n\r\nWe believe that under-representation leads to decisions that often don\u2019t reflect the needs of the community, such as laws that fail to protect farmworkers in the state and federal level, a broken immigration system that separates families, unequal allocation of resources, city ordinances that fail to pave the roads of Latino dense neighborhoods, etc. \r\n\r\nRoot causes\r\n\r\nSome of the primary root causes of these problems include: lack of/in-access to (higher) education, due to one\u2019s lower-income status and/or barriers due to immigration status; and a Lack of trust/confidence in the political process, which may stem from lack of knowledge or from years of perceived injustice in the allocation of resources and prejudices in laws that becomes reinforced year after year.\r\n\r\nThis coupled by a deficit of leaders that are representative of the community, are capable, driven, and principled to make decisions in the political realm makes it that much more difficult to make lasting change. Even more, these same root causes often creates a similar deficit of leaders in the social justice movement. \r\n\r\nBuilding collective power\r\n\r\nWe build collective power by forming a coalition between sister organizations, such as CAUSA Oregon or PCUN (Oregon\u2019s farmworker union), and capture the history and experiences to create a popular education curriculum that can benefit future leaders. We organize university faculty members across the state, and key strategic leaders who have powerful ideas and expertise that can help us form innovative programs.\r\n\r\nAddressing the root causes\r\n\r\nOur leadership curriculum may not change the root causes of under-representation, but it works to address the \u2018deficit of leaders. One of the tools we use in CAPACES Leadership Institute is popular education, often described as education for critical consciousness, which has Latin America traditions that often targeted low-income and marginalized communities. The concept: rather than have top-down teaching such as teacher-pupil, we have peer-to-peer teaching initiated by a facilitator. The premise: that no matter what occupation, income bracket, and level of formal education, everyone can participate and contribute by drawing upon their life experience or through engaging activities described as dinamicas. Popular education makes information more accessible for those with barriers to formal education.\r\n\r\nThe CLI currently offeres CAPACES 101 (our history and principles) and Fundraising 101 (fundraising principles) for emerging leaders. We are developing higher courses of leadership development, one of which will include \"People's Representative\" for those seeking an elected position.",

The CLI has also established a committee, composed mostly of board members and board alternates, expressly to guide the planning, evaluation of CLI programs, participation levels and program impacts. Additionally, the CLI\u201ds \u201ccouncil of advisors\u201d composed of 61 allies in non-profit training institutions and academic institutions whose work has intersected with immigration and immigrant communities, will serve as the projects external advisory group.", 
    "narrative5": "The CAPACES Leadership Institute collaborates with nine different sister organizations that tackle issues such as Education reform (Salem Keizer Coalition for Equality), Immigrant rights (Causa Oregon), Women empowerment (Mujeres Luchardores Progresistas), and farmworker justice (PCUN), to name a few.\r\n\u2022\tOne specific collaboration we recently had between these different organizations was we organized a regularly planned event we call \u201cMass Gatherings\u201d where we unite the leaders, organizers, and volunteers of our nine sister organizations. An example of a past mass gathering topic was a 2-part discussion on Homophobia. The first class focused on the roots of homophobia, as the second class addressed LGBTQ terminology and how we can be better allies to combat homophobia with the families and communities we organize in. These mass gatherings allow us to be knowledgeable to the issues that impact our community but also the broader community. It helps make our CAPACES Network movement more knowledgeable and understanding to the needs of the broader progressive community.\r\n\r\nAnother collaboration we've had was Green Hammer, a Portland based design-build firm leading in sustainable building practices and architects. We collaborated to build the leadership institute (construction completed last August) in Passive House technology. Dylan Lamar from greenhammer described passive house as: \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced building energy-efficiency standard and it centers around three simple principles: insulation, air-tightness, and heat-recovery ventilation.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn our collaboration with greenhammer we also organized events with the central theme \"What do Green Cards have to do with the green movement\", connecting the green movement or architects with the brown (Latino-immigrant right's) movement who have green cards (legal residency). This collaboration created an opportunity to connect two movements that rarely have opportunities to interact in a dialogue. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "The CAPACES Leadership Institute addresses inequality, oppression and discrimination through its five-part \u201cCAPACES 101\u201d classes which explore the different \u201cisms\u201d such as: racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, as well as homophobia. The class is taught through a \u201cpopular education\u201d format which draws from the experiences of the class participants utilizing a class facilitator who digs deep into those experiences. Discussions tend to challenge participants own prejudices as they explore experiences outside of their own.\r\n\r\nThe CAPACES 101 class on \u201cisms\u201d also puts an emphasis in analyzing the differences between personal prejudice and institutional discrimination. This analysis equips class participants with the tools to distinguish what forms of inequality or discrimination lie in the category of personal prejudice and institutional discrimination, which is important for young and old organizers to be able to identify correctly to effectively organize against some of the \u201cisms\u201d in the community. \r\n\r\nThe class participants of CAPACES 101 tend to be young and old organizers and volunteers in the CAPACES Network composed of nine different organizations who in their own work promote racial justice whether it is women\u2019s rights, education reform, or immigrant rights. Most of the class participants come from Latino-immigrant background. \r\n",

Smart Justice Campaign\u2019s goal is to push Spokane County to fully fund and implement alternatives to incarceration and critical support services for non-violent offenders. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the Smart Justice Campaign: Formed a diverse coalition of 28 organizations; reached agreement on a platform; developed a website with the RiverStyx Foundation\u2019s support \u2013 www.smartjusticespokane.org; launched in September by hosting a Smart Justice forum with Douglas Marlowe, J.D., Ph.D., an expert in alternatives to incarceration, attended by over 150 people; and developed a Who is in the Jail handout with local jail data, and wrote over 15 White Papers on alternatives to incarceration. The Smart Justice Campaign held a one-day Smart Justice Symposium on November 9 attended by over 200 people that resulted in a broader understanding by elected officials and community leaders on the need for alternatives to incarceration in Spokane.  \r\n\r\nIn early 2013, the Campaign Steering Committee developed and reached agreement on policy recommendations that include::\r\n-       Adopt a Smart Justice lens throughout the criminal justice system.\r\n-\tImplement study of racial bias and disparity.

    "narrative3": "We are building collective power by bringing together communities that are directly impacted by incarceration to advocate for alternatives to incarceration. The Campaign is pushing elected officials to address root causes of poverty and crime, rather than just focus on cost saving measures. We are working with clergy who see the impact of incarceration on their congregations, service providers that work with ex-offenders and their families, and the mental health and disability community to end the practice of using the jail as a mental health facility. We want to reduce the number of people impacted by incarceration and poverty so they become productive members of our society and have a voice in the political process, which builds political power for the long-term.\r\n\r\nThe Campaign is advocating for a more efficient and effective response to crime than incarceration with the goal of creating a safer community, lowering costs, and changing lives. We are incarcerating too many non-violent offenders at great cost to offenders and their families, to the safety of our community, and disproportionately impacting communities of color, low-income, and people with disabilities. \r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. There are proven alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders that can save money, reduce crime, and hold people accountable while keeping people with their families and in their jobs; preserving jail beds for high-risk violent offenders who pose a danger to our community. We call this Smart Justice and we want to see it in Spokane.\r\n\r\nIncarceration is the most expensive and least effect option to prevent criminal behavior and make our community safer. Jail impacts employment, housing, school, medical care, and health care coverage; takes parents away from their children; and we are making people worse. The focus needs to shift from the \"offense\" to the \"offender\" so interventions hold people accountable for their crime and make people better so they are less likely to reoffend. We need to assess offenders' risks and needs to better match offenders with programming such as electric home monitoring, day reporting, therapeutic courts (i.e. Drug Court, Mental Health Court). We also need to provide critical support services like drug and alcohol and mental health treatment, housing, and job training and placement. Prevention and diversion programs are needed to keep people from being arrested in the first place. Programs must evidence-based, target specific needs, be non-discriminatory, and culturally appropriate. \r\n\r\nSmart Justice will help build a healthy and safe community in which criminal justice dollars are well spent, victim needs are met, criminal behavior is reduced, the cycle of crime is ended, and offenders are held accountable. Smart Justice offers each offender an opportunity to regain hope and dignity and become a healthy and productive individual.\r\n",

    "narrative4": "We have an opportunity to shape criminal justice reform in Spokane County and become a model for what Smart Justice looks like.  In November 2012, a joint City-County Regional Criminal Justice Commission was charged with developing recommendations on criminal justice reform. Our Campaign is using this process to advocate for our policies, educate elected officials and the public about the need for Smart Justice, continue to build, diversify, and engage our coalition, and mobilize grassroots support. The Commission has expressed support for the Campaign and Smart Justice programs. It is a Campaign priority to make sure the Commission meets and listens to leaders of color and other disproportionately impacted communities, and we will turn out supporters to their hearing this fall. \r\n\r\nOur biggest challenge will be to get the City and County to fully adopt and fund the recommendations. Strong grassroots support from impacted communities and key districts will be imperative in gaining support from Commission and elected officials and will also build long-term political power in underrepresented communities to advocate for policy change. Our organizing will focus on communities of color and the faith community. With only a few people of color led non-profit organizations in Spokane, people of color clergy play an important role in advocating for their community.\r\n\r\nThe Campaign is focusing on the following strategies: \r\n-\tConvince criminal justice policy makers to adopt the Smart Justice Campaign Policy Recommendations; \r\n-\tUrge County Commissioners to try Smart Justice before funding a new jail; \r\n-\tEducate ourselves and the community about Smart Justice using a racial equity lens consistently; \r\n-\tDevelop grassroots support and engage supporters in advocating for Smart Justice; and\r\n-\tIncrease the involvement and leadership of people of color and other underrepresented communities, and work with leaders in these communities to develop (and set specific goals) and implement work plans.

The coalitions that are representative of our approach to building strong coalitions led by those most affected are the committees on Approve R-74 and the Smart Justice Campaign.\r\n\r\nIt has been a slow process, but our work in the community advocating for the freedom to marry and Smart Justice have provided important opportunities to build relationships and trust, and work with partners on issues that directly impact them. Our role has been to build bridges and coordinate the work of coalition partners in order to increase their capacity, as well as increase collaboration and participation in order to achieve a more significant impact.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lack of organizing infrastructure and capacity in Spokane, and, even more so in communities of color and the LGBTQ community. Our progress in being able to fully engage leaders of color and in the LGBTQ community has been a slow, intentional, but ultimately fruitful process.\r\n\r\nThe Smart Justice campaign has allowed us to engage with communities of color in a much more significant way, and to work with those communities to establish trust. We took time to have meetings with leaders to get their input and buy in and held a convening meeting to make sure that there was support for moving forward with the campaign. ",

They are frustrated about the lack of resources for schools and community centers in low-income communities. They spoke about the high drop out rates for African American, Hispanic, and Native American youth, the impact on families with fathers and parents in jail, and the lack of resources to support families impacted by incarceration. \r\n\r\nThe pastors also spoke about the challenges of encouraging other pastors in their community to advocate for Smart Justice. They are all tired of talking with elected officials about the problems in their community and have nothing come of it. We currently have an all-white male three-member commission, and an all-white elected officials that are not listening to people of color in our community. The pastors asked for the support of white clergy, not only in the progressive churches, but also from the larger influential churches to meet with them \u2013 possibly to develop a joint statement \u2013 and ask them to join them in a meeting with the Commission to tell their stories and talk about the reforms that would benefit communities of color. \r\n\r\nWe have also heard a similar story from Native American leaders in Spokane. This is why GSP and the Campaign are committed to being part of a unified voice for racial justice and equality in our community. GSP and Campaign member groups are majority white and are committed to acting as an ally to communities of color, to show up, to listen, to build relationships, to provide support and add capacity, and to take action together. As an ally we need to continue to speak out against institutional racism in our criminal justice system and in other institutions. GSP has made a commitment to use a racial equity lens in our campaigns and throughout our network, and increase the leadership of people of color.  In order to help make us stronger allies, GSP is organizing our second racial justice training focused on using a racial equity lens in our campaigns for members and Campaign Coalition partners to be led by Glenn Harris with the City of Seattle Office for Civil Rights, similar to the workshop Glenn taught at Western State Centers\u2019 AMP. We are also formally requesting that Glenn give a presentation to the Criminal Justice Commission on how to use a racial equity lens in developing their reform recommendations.   \r\n\r\n",

We are incarcerating a disproportionate number of people of color, and people with mental illness and disabilities, and low-income people compared to our population. In 2011, 12% of the Spokane County Jail population was African American, while they are only 1.7 % of Spokane County\u2019s population. Bookings of Native Americans (over 24 hours) were 5.9% of the total, while only 1.5% of our population. In a study of 100 inmates, 36% had received mental health treatment and 38% wanted mental health counseling. Lack of employment opportunities have put people at risk of engaging in criminal activities, and incarceration has a huge impact on ex-offenders\u2019 ability to find employment and support their families. A lack of programs available for mental health, and drug and alcohol treatment make it difficult for people to become a healthy productive individual in our community. \r\n\r\nThe institutional bias in our current system against people of color, people with disabilities, and people living in poverty must be eliminated and their needs must be specifically addressed.\r\n\r\n",

While South Asian communities are very diverse, with people hailing from numerous countries and representing many cultural experiences, languages and religions, many issues are commonly stigmatized in our communities and are not publicly discussed. Much of Tasveer\u2019s programming has been focused on bringing light to these often difficult issues, empowering artists to tell their stories and audiences to engage in conversations. Some of these activities have included: \r\n-a first-ever South Asian LGBTQ Film Festival, which was presented in addition to the South Asian LGBTQ films that are regularly programmed into our Annual South Asian Film Festival; \r\n-a talk by an activist/writer about domestic violence and dowry laws in India; \r\n-a film screening fundraiser to benefit HIV/AIDS work in India; \r\n-sponsorship of South Asian films in the Seattle Human Rights Film Festival;\r\n-sponsorship of Indian Gay Lesbian Festival called Kashik:\r\n-organizing anti-homophobia workshop in the community;\r\n-films and panel discussions marking the 20th and 25th anniversaries of the Bhopal disaster; and\r\n-the annual Aaina: South Asian Women\u2019s Festival, a presentation of films, performance art (a highlight of which is Yoni Ki Baat), visual art, speakers and discussions focused on issues \u2013 such as domestic violence, reproductive rights, gender issues and sexuality \u2013 relevant to South Asian women. \r\n \r\n",

    "narrative3": "Tasveer\u2019s work through Yoni Ki Baat (YKB) is based on the premise that, by thoughtfully but intentionally bringing such taboo issues into the forefront of community discussions, our peers can begin to feel more at ease in acknowledging the existence of such issues and begin taking action to improve community well-being. One past participant talked about being divorced and how she lost friends as a result. Another talked about being bisexual and yet another talked about how her decision not to have a child alienated her from her parents. \r\n\r\nYoni Ki Baat (South Asian Vagina Monologues) is a growing collection of authentic, bold, powerful and poignant stories, written and performed by South Asian women. YKB has become a flagship event of Aaina and will be presented at 9th AAINA: South Asian Women\u2019s Focus in April, 2014 at Seattle Asian Art Museum.  \r\n\r\nThe root cause of these issues is one being an immigrant, underserved community we are afraid speak out about our problems. We don't want to be alienated in our own community or afraid of being treated differently.  It is a stigma to discuss about mental disabilities, bully, autism, racial discrimination, and much more. \r\n\r\nSecondly, South Asian cultures, which are often conventionally-oriented, typically discourage women from voicing concerns about problems that may jeopardize community cohesion. Such issues include gender and sexuality issues, which are highly stigmatized. There is an unspoken understanding that these issues are better left unacknowledged. Women who do voice such concerns lose community support. For example, domestic violence is thought of as best dealt with within the context of the family. A woman\u2019s public acknowledgment of abuse by a partner can cause her to be isolated by other community members. Many immigrant and refugee women (as many local South Asians are) are challenged by lack of familiarity with American systems, language and cultural barriers, lack of independent financial resources and other significant barriers, and being cut off from a community network can have devastating consequences. This fear about the lack of peer support means that many domestic violence survivors remain with their abusers. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe are noticing the trend of change in our community. Publicly talking about these stigmas in front of SA audiences helps participants and audience members alike to understand individual and shared experiences.  Our community is becoming bold. For example when we first started out the South Asian version of the Vagina Monologues, it was hard to promote or seek participants for YKB.  Every year our festival give courage to many to come out and take part. 100% our YKB participants every year are past audience members. It is no longer a hush hush event to come see YKB anymore.\r\n\r\nOur KBCS phone interview.\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/19wZVFW",

Tasveer holds the unique distinction of producing the only South Asian Women's Focused festival in the country.\r\n\r\nTasveer\u2019s goals for the 2013-2014 program are:\r\n-To empower local South Asians;\r\n- to give a platform to youth to discuss issues around their Identity, in Youth Voices a program of Aaina;\r\n-To collect stories/narratives that shed light on issues based on sexuality and gender identity, in the South Asian socio-cultural context;\r\n- Provide a safe space for participants speak about taboo issues like depression, racial discrimination, female infanticide, bullying, peer pressure- issues which cannot be discussed publicly in any other space in Seattle; \r\n-To provide a form of entertainment that is socially conscious and counters sexual and domestic violence;\r\n-To collaborate with socially-conscious organizations such as API Chaya, Trikone-Northwest;\r\n-To be a model for other communities of color to address issues of gender and sexuality in their own cultural contexts.\r\n\r\nStrategies to achieve these goals will include coaching and support provided to South Asians participating in the writing and telling stories, organizing forums to speak and conduct programs.\r\n\r\nOur outcomes will be measured by:\r\n-Participation in organizing the project \r\n-Attendance. At least 200+ people will attend each day. \r\n-Donation amount made to the beneficiary \u2013 Till now we have donated $10,000+ to API Chaya (formerly known as Chaya.)\r\n-The number of women participating \u2013 At least 20 women will apply and 10 of them will perform; 100% will reside in the Pacific Northwest.\r\n-The personal growth trajectories of women who have participated in YKB \u2013 Through pre-and post-program self-assessments, participants will show more confidence in their ability to effect change in their community. \r\n",

We provide all participants \u201csafe space,\u201d which is characterized by active listening, compassion, non-judgmental attitude, mutual respect, trust, confidentiality, collaboration and community. During the final three-day performance, domestic violence advocates from API Chaya, a domestic violence agency, provide safety and support to participants and audience members by being available to anyone who might want to know more about. \r\n\r\nTasveer uses API Chaya's expertise in how facilitate a discussion properly in talking difficult subjects with the DV survivors participants. As a result of the the collaboration the community becomes aware of the  safe space and help is available if needed. In some case if someone wants to talk to an advocate they are available throughout the festival. \r\n\r\nSimilarly with Trikone Northwest we seek out participation from our queer community, listen to their stories and initiate a dialog with them. Our intent to diminish the homophobia, and prejudices among our community.

She related the topic to us more making it more comfortable.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn Community Speaks participants speak out about racial discrimination, gender inequality and oppression in workplace.  A comment by a White audience member after listening to a racial discrimination story. \"I had no idea this still happened here, people could be so hateful.\" It was a reaction to the story of a South Asian man, a professor in a college, who was called \"sand nigger\" in a parking lot in Issaquah. Also it was interesting to see how many came forward to tell their stories after they hear a story similar to theirs. Then the advocate gives resource material on what to do where to go  when something like this happens. As a result of the Community Speaks feedback will also be conducting some workshop with the Office of Civil Rights.\r\n\r\nThrough Yoni Ki Baat at Aaina, we are able to address nuances of South Asian cultures. YKB has provided that opportunity to South Asian women to speak up about the challenges of taboo, gender based discrimination, oppression of and violence against women, and simply, the lack of expression at the core of womanhood and related socio political and economic issues. \r\n\r\nEach year, during the Q&A session that follows the performance we hear feedback from the South Asian as well as other audience members how much they relate to the stories and how they resonate with them on a deeply personal level.\r\n\r\nLarge, diverse audiences whose exposure to YKB stories motivate them to take action in social justice issues. \r\n",

When the wider community sees that the problem is not personal failings of homeless people, but systematic failings of the wider community, genuine solutions - such as shelter and housing - start getting built.c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative1": "In 1995 homeless youth organized a concert (Peace for the Streets by Kids from the Streets) to raise awareness about the impacts of the Becca Bill, a truancy law with adverse impacts on youth who left home due to family crisis. The concert attracted 1,500 people and helped build momentum to modify the law to allow time to understand a young person\u2019s situation before sending them back to an unsafe home. The success of this effort inspired these young people to continue to bring awareness to issues impacting them.\r\nStarting out of her apartment, former teacher Elaine Simons began work with a cohort of youth who wanted to complete their education and learn to become effective advocates. Originally set up under the fiscal umbrella of the Seattle Neighborhood Group, PSKS was able to start receiving grants and donations to continue their work and move out of the apartment into a space on Capitol Hill. \r\nOver the next several years, Simons and her homeless students lobbied on many issues, both on the streets of Seattle and in the halls of state and local government. As they got more engaged, they also realized a need to provide services to fill unmet community needs. In order to secure funding for these programs, PSKS sought and secured its own 501(c) 3 status in 2000. The by-laws, with input from participants, established a governance structure that formalizes input and voting rights for CORE participants. \r\nPSKS continues to be engaged in issues adversely affecting homeless youth. Community wide initiatives to \u201cend homelessness\u201d impose a top-down approach that fails to acknowledge or address the underlying economic and social justice issues.

    "narrative3": "According to national research most youth, through no fault of their own, end up homeless due to abuse and neglect from parents or caregivers and have no place to turn. Once homeless, many acquire additional barriers to employment and housing such as:  missing proper identification; little or no work experience; evictions due to lack of income, addictions or mental health conditions; pets that offer comfort but are not allowed in day centers, programs or housing;  or circumstances that may result in jail time. \r\nResearch shows that even a single instance of exclusion can undermine well-being. PSKS serves a unique, and exceptionally underserved, population. Young people who arrive at PSKS have often been excluded from, or avoided, mainstream homeless youth services and transitional living situations, and continue couch surfing or live under bridges, in cars or tents until they can secure their own homes. These situations can reinforce a young person\u2019s feelings of isolation and despair. \r\nThese young people can be caught in a vicious cycle that makes it challenging to complete an education, gain work experience, and generate the resources and community support they need to secure and maintain safe and stable housing. If they don\u2019t receive support to overcome these barriers, these young people are at great risk of becoming chronically homeless.\r\nMost homeless youth service providers in Seattle rely on strict rules and top-down imposed goals for their participants. While this approach has helped many homeless youth transition off the streets, many more don\u2019t fit well into rigid and inflexible environments where well-meaning service providers impose goals impossible to achieve in their unique situation. PSKS offers the lowest barrier access to services for homeless youth and young adults, and animal companions, in Seattle. Our commitment to harm reduction elevates the safety and security of individuals over rigid standards that many youth are unable to meet at this time in their life.\r\nOver the past 18 years, PSKS has witnessed many of our peer agencies shutting down. PSKS has outlasted services for our homeless and impoverished neighbors such as Capitol Hill Youth Drop in Center, Street Links, Street Outreach Services and numerous feeding programs. Our Capitol Hill location fills a tremendous local need while public transit provides ready access to vulnerable youth from throughout the greater Seattle region whose needs are not well-met elsewhere.\r\nOur ability to engage and empower this population is a direct result of our CORE Membership of current and formerly homeless youth and young adults who provide guidance and leadership in support of organizational and community-wide programs and policies. It is this bottom up approach that empowers individuals to identify and reach their own goals tap into their unique strengths and ultimately survive to thrive.",

In December 2012, Susan Fox, MSW, was hired as an Interim Executive Director. Susan is a professional and passionate advocate for our participant-driven approach; bringing out the best from our CORE Members, staff and Board of Directors; and laying the groundwork for a successful leadership transition. The hiring process is underway and we anticipate that CORE, staff and Board hiring committee members will bring a new Executive Director on board early in our new fiscal year.\r\nUnder new leadership, a review and thorough update our strategic goals is essential. We are entering year two of a three year strategic plan and are making progress toward our goals. The current plan was developed with extensive participation from CORE, and our broader participant community, with significant input from staff and the Board of Directors. A multi-year strategic plan, including specific revenue goals, will be completed by the end of our 2013 fiscal year. \r\nIn the near-term, PSKS is working with our community partners and allies to bring fresh energy and broader perspectives and community networks to our work\u2014especially from communities of color. Our goal is to bring on at least 7 solid and committed new board members over the coming year. We will also be actively recruiting CORE members from beyond our immediate community of youth\u2014reaching out for a broader range of voices to guide our work.\r\nAnother challenge for the new ED includes securing a lease for program operations. Our current lease expires at the end of October, 2013. We are working with a leasing agent on a pro-bono basis as an advocate and ally. A permanent, long term solution will be part of the strategic update.", 
    "narrative5": "PSKS has a fundamental commitment to social justice and understands the value and strength of empowering those we serve to shape our vision for the future.  We have created a community of mutually beneficial and enriching relationships. Many of our youth are actively involved in systems change through various methods from active protest to community outreach and education. Through PSKS, these young people can find individuals who share their values and vision of a better world.\r\n\r\nOne of our strongest allies to emerge in the past year is with Seattle First Baptist Church (SFBC) Social Justice Committee. This is a well-connected ally group, based in our neighborhood that seeks to understand who we are and support what we do. Importantly, they require no expectations of faith or belief. They seek only to find and engage kindred spirits for social change and offer their support. \r\n\r\nSFBC has provided both cash and in-kind support to PSKS, and they are a part of an extended community with additional resources and connections that will benefit PSKS and our ability to achieve our mission. We are currently developing opportunities for new board members and volunteers. SFBC has strong ally relationships with other Baptist Churches in the community serving Black, Asian and Latino/a and Hispanic populations. Through SFBC, PSKS is working to develop relationships that further align the demographics of our leadership with those we serve.\r\n\r\nAnother example of community collaboration is Occupy CEHKC (Commission to End Homelessness of King County). For many years PSKS staff and participants have both participated and represented homeless youth as a participant in this commission. While we recognize the value of having a seat at the table we will take a stand to ensure that economic and social justice issues are addressed. ", 
    "narrative6": "PSKS maintains a diverse work environment and has established many social and collaborative relationships with a broad cross-section of our community. Our staff, board, core and interns all reflect our commitment to an inclusive community, representing no less than ten different cultures, four major religions and significant representation from people with an experience of homelessness, identifying as LGBTQ and managing mental health, disabilities and addiction recovery. Our current case manager and Program Coordinator both have experience with homelessness and addiction and between them represent gender, sexual and cultural diversity.\r\nThe main strength in cultural competence at PSKS comes from our anti oppressive and empowerment model. Taking harm reduction to the community level, we meet people as they are and work with them to connect with the most appropriate resources to help them thrive. PSKS values our ability to meet the needs of varied populations and provide culturally appropriate services as they arise. For example: When we had difficulty communicating with the mother of two Eritrean immigrants participating at PSKS, we reached out and connected with the Eritrean community to facilitate translation.\r\nIt is our goal to take a more active allyship role to communities of color. PSKS Board, CORE, Staff and volunteers all recently participate in an anti-oppression training and we are seeking new community relationships to strengthen our diversity and partnership organizations. It is a priority in the coming year to extend and broaden the diversity of our community networks as we seek new staff and board members.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The need for leadership/community development in Idaho is crucial.  Approximately 11% of Idaho\u2019s populations are women of color (WOC); however, only two women of color serve in the Idaho legislature, including one of WOCA\u2019s founding mothers, elected in November, 2010.  Women of color, particularly Hispanic/Latina and Native American women are much more likely to live in poverty in Idaho than Idaho white women.  The education level and average annual wages are significantly lower for WOC than the general population, made worse by Idaho\u2019s rural landscape.  In contrast, WOCA\u2019s Board of Directors is comprised 100% of women of color.  Women obtain valuable training and support in identifying and challenging oppression resulting from racism, sexism and economic injustice.  WOC now serve in public office, start their own businesses, and strengthen their families and communities by making safer, healthier choices for themselves with support from various training programs.  \r\nOur goal is to maintain our strong presence in Idaho; Women and people of color look to us for leadership and yes defiance.  We continue to move forward with a limited budget and no staff, but yet we persevere. In 2010, Idaho\u2019s Women\u2019s Network closed their doors after 20 years, their finally plea to seek public financial support fell on deaf ears, WOCA\u2019s leadership addressed the importance of IWN\u2019s existence in the media and made its final plea to keep IWN\u2019s doors open.  Today, WOCA is the only women\u2019s political organization that addresses race and gender, and maintains a working and positive relationship with the tribal women leadership from Coeur d\u2019Alene, Kootenai, Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock, and Shoshone-Paiute. WOCA\u2019s ability to create film and put a face and voice to the past actions of this state toward communities of color have ignited statewide conversations often lead by Native women.  WOCA maintains its history and leadership as the only organization to create film and continued opened dialogue.  Through this network, we empower ourselves and provide the tools to face the challenges we meet in everyday life. Our strong and creative leadership, provides workshops and trainings that give women the skills they need to run or support women running for office, and cultivate independence and to address the lack of representation within the existing power structure in Idaho.

Through community organizing and advocacy, OSA\u2019s seven member campuses build power for students, dismantle oppression, and break down institutional barriers to higher education.  OSA fights to make public postsecondary education affordable, equitable, and safe for all Oregonians.  \r\nIn the 1970\u2019s, students at Oregon public universities won control over the student incidental fee, the purpose of which is to enhance students\u2019 educational experience.  Students used their control of this fee to begin a tradition of facilitating a student-led process to fund services, advocacy, and organizing priorities they believed were important to their campuses and communities.  It was through this process that campuses became founding members of OSA.\r\nSince 1975, OSA has fought to keep higher education accessible for low-income Oregonians by securing millions of dollars in state funding for need-based aid, public universities, and community colleges. Because students of color and queer students have effectively created a 2/3 majority within OSA\u2019s leadership and provide significant direction for our work, OSA has also become a meaningful part of social justice movements in Oregon.  OSA has organized to protect diversity scholarships, address racial profiling, prevent campus public safety officers from carrying weapons, win gender inclusive spaces on campus, and pass anti-bullying legislation. OSA led the coalition that passed Tuition Equity into law in 2013 after a 10-year fight to allow qualifying undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates at public universities. We have built grassroots, electoral power in communities across Oregon by registering over 160,000 students to vote in the last decade.  Finally, our campaigns and student leadership conferences have successfully developed countless leaders and organizers who continue to support the movement for progressive social change even after graduation. \r\n",

Students face inequitable policies on campus, a national student debt crisis, cuts to state higher education funding, and a decrease in services on campus for traditionally underserved communities. \r\n\r\nDeeply rooted, institutional barriers fuel these problems. Hundreds of years of oppressive policies continue to prevent communities of color from attaining adequate representation on college campuses across Oregon and the country.  Stark income inequality and continual state disinvestment in public colleges and need-based aid programs have created significant barriers that prevent low-income students from achieving social mobility\u2014even if they are able to access a college degree.  The largest determining factor of whether or not a student will go to college is if their parent(s) went.  \r\n\r\nThankfully, OSA addresses these barriers by building collective power on local, statewide, and national levels by registering and turning out tens of thousands of students to vote each election cycle.  We use that power to put pressure on elected officials through significant student-led organizing.  We lobby for budgets and policies that improve students\u2019 lives.  \r\n\r\nThrough our annual conferences, internship programs, and day-to-day organizing, we support the leadership development of student government and student group members. This gives us a strong base of leaders who can sustain our work.  We protect the institutional control of the student incidental fee that students at universities and Lane Community College (LCC) have won.  This control allows for students to continually fund the work and staff of OSA.  Just as importantly, incidental fee control gives students access to resources, power, and self-determination on campus they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.  Student control over incidental fees means that students can use their own, democratic process to fund the establishment of a student parent childcare subsidy program, increase sexual assault support services, or build a multicultural resource center. All of these real examples of student incidental fee priorities (and more) improve outcomes for traditionally underserved communities on our campuses.  \r\n\r\nWhile we only represent one community college at this time (LCC), we have begun to help students at other community colleges organize for more control over their incidental fees.  Since community college campuses include larger populations of students of color, student parents, low-income, and first-generation students than universities, it is even more critical that we assist the communities attending school there with the process of building institutional power, gaining incidental fee control, and organizing collectively.  We hope this organizing can ultimately yield more dues-paying member campuses of OSA. If it does, we can continue to grow the student movement for social justice in Oregon without having to rely on foundation funding.  In itself, this is empowering.\r\n",

    "narrative4": "This year, OSA will continue to advocate and organize statewide for affordability, equity and quality in public postsecondary education. We will also re-start our \u201cissue-choosing\u201d cycle by conducting surveys, researching, and making policy decisions to create our agenda for Oregon\u2019s next full legislative session (2015).   We will raise voter registration money to kick off our 2014 voter registration efforts next spring.   \r\n\r\nThat said, the workplan we\u2019ve included below reflects goals and strategies of a new project that will help us build on unprecedented momentum to solidify Oregon students\u2019 organizing infrastructure. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, we partnered with our 501(c)3 to raise enough civic engagement money to place temporary organizers on non-member community college campuses and register 50,000 students to vote statewide with their support.  Organizers built strong enough relationships between OSA and non-members that we could continue engaging them in our collective advocacy and organizing throughout the 2013 legislative session.  Temporary organizers are gone and the session is ending; the next step of our organizing on non-member community colleges needs to be sustained by an additional staff member who can continue to provide support and contact from OSA.  In contrast to permanent OSA staff whose salaries are funded by membership dues, we would like to establish a grant-funded organizer who will 1) maintain relationships, design curriculum, and create organizing strategies to assist students at non-member community colleges to gain control over their incidental fees, and 2) increase these students\u2019 ability to pursue OSA membership and a more sustainable student movement.  We have already laid the groundwork and tested the feasibility of this position through the work our increased staff capacity allowed us to do to recruit a new partial dues-paying member campus (Central Oregon Community College) in 2012.  We have a smart plan to move forward; all we need now is funding.    \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Oregon\u2019s Tuition Equity coalition is an example of how we provide leadership to larger movements for social change.  A decade ago, students of color and undocumented students within OSA first prioritized supporting Senate Bill 9 (SB9), Oregon\u2019s initial version of a \u201cTuition Equity\u201d bill. SB9 would ensure that qualifying students in Oregon could pay in-state tuition rates at our public universities.  Since then, we have built and led a coalition made up of OSA, Causa, Center for Intercultural Organizing, the Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon, Oregon DREAMers, Latinos Unidos Siempre, and other coalition partners fighting for racial and immigrant justice in Oregon.  Through the busloads of students OSA organized to attend hearings, the key constituents Causa recruited to speak at lobby days, the personal stories Oregon DREAMers told to panels of legislators, and more collaboration, this coalition was finally able to pass Tuition Equity this spring.  Now, our strong relationships with these coalition partners mean that OSA and other advocacy organizations are better equipped than ever to take on the next big 10-year policy battle for racial, immigrant, and educational justice in Oregon.\r\n\r\nOSA\u2019s participation in the Coalition for Safety and Savings is an example of how we contribute to broader movements for social change in a supportive role.  This coalition is led by Partnership for Safety and Justice, which works to make Oregon\u2019s approach to public safety more effective and just.  Together with other members of the Coalition for Safety and Savings, OSA has dedicated student and staff capacity during the 2013 legislative session to advocating for smart reforms to Oregon\u2019s mandatory minimum sentencing and youth sentencing laws. We\u2019ve joined sexual assault advocacy organizations, K-12 coalition partners, and others in the fight to address the institutional barriers and budget constraints that unjust incarceration practices create for our communities. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "We prioritize strong, consistent leadership development for students of color in order to make sure that they are empowered to take on leadership roles in the work of OSA, student organizations on campus, and their communities.  We also focus our organizing and advocacy on issues that will break down institutional barriers and build power for communities of color.  \r\nEach year board members from the Oregon Students of Color Coalition direct OSA\u2019s Oregon Students of Color Conference, which brings together nearly 500 students of color from across Oregon for three days of workshops, networking, keynote speakers, and strategizing for racial justice. We also prioritize giving trainings focused on identity development for both students of color and white allies at our other student leadership conferences throughout the year so that all of our members can be developed to understand their role in the movement for social justice.  Additionally, we recognize the role that intersecting identities play in shaping students\u2019 experience on campus and in their communities and we work to help students build an intersectional approach to their work.  Last year we offered the first-ever \u201cQPOC\u201d (Queer Person of Color) track at the Oregon Students of Color Conference so that students could feel recognized for and empowered in their multiple identities throughout that event.  This year was the first time our Oregon Student Equal Rights Alliance board organized a conference of their own; they opted to focus the theme of the entire day on intersecting identities and opportunities for broad coalitions and movements for social change.\r\nIn addition to our leadership development strategies, our commitment to racial justice is evident within our issue agenda.  Our largest legislative policy priority for the last ten years was passing Tuition Equity, an issue that has broken down institutional barriers and altered relations of power for communities of color and immigrant communities in Oregon.  Other issues we have supported this year such as mandatory minimum sentencing reform, increased data collection that will give the state a more accurate understanding of the needs of underserved communities, and mandatory cultural competency training for healthcare providers have helped us work towards our goal of achieving racial justice for students and communities in Oregon.  One of our biggest budget advocacy priorities is the Oregon Opportunity Grant.  This is Oregon\u2019s only form of need-based aid and we are expecting 2013 to be the third year in a row that OSA has effectively lobbied for increasing the amount of grants that the state funds.  This is a significant victory in achieving economic justice, but also overlaps with our goal of achieving racial justice since a disproportionately large amount of students of color qualify for need-based aid in comparison to their white peers.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "RLTS began as a small group of Native people, known as Native American Religious Service volunteers at the Oregon Department of Corrections.  Working closely with incarcerated Native Americans, we experienced firsthand the \u2018revolving door\u2019 known as recidivism. Inmates would confide in us, \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to go, I don\u2019t know what I will do.\u201d In February 2006 we formed a Board of Directors and began the process of crafting our mission and purpose: To prevent incarceration of Native Americans and provide assistance to incarcerated Native Americans who are proactively working toward creating a better life for themselves, their children, and their communities. Upon receiving non-profit status in 2007, we have continuously worked to promote and develop culturally competent pre and post incarceration programs which aid in prevention, responsibility, respect and empowerment of individuals, families and communities.  \r\n\r\nThe heart of our organization is our volunteer base, which has grown to over 70 community members. With their unwavering support, RLTS is gaining recognition within the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) administration and Native communities as a strong voice for incarcerated Native people. We are proud of our core prison programs, which have expanded and been refined over the last year in order to improve outcomes and serve more individuals. Yet, RLTS\u2019s major accomplishment is that the effects of RLTS can now \u2014and will continue to\u2014 be seen throughout the community. The visible effects of RLTS include:                                                                                                                        \r\n\u2022\tMore awareness about the realities of prison in the general community.\r\n\u2022\tSystematic change within ODOC, especially regarding Native Americans and re-entry planning.\r\n\u2022\tEmpowerment of more than 700 incarcerated and 58 released Native Americans and 10 others.\r\n\u2022\tHealing of intergenerational historical trauma from the legacy of genocide and substance abuse within Oregon tribes. \r\n\u2022\tNative community building, including specific support for children and families of incarcerated individuals. \r\n",

If I hadn\u2019t come to prison, I would never have seen a model of strong, responsible, respectful women.\u201d RLTS client.\r\n\r\nRLTS believes the high disparity levels of intergenerational incarceration among Native Americans is directly related to repeated historical traumas, violence, poverty, and substance abuse experienced and passed down through the generations. Historical trauma has been described as \u201cthe distress and suffering resulting from numerous compounding historically traumatic events experienced by a community over several generations\u201d (Yellow Horse Brave Heart, 1996). \r\n\r\nThe root causes of Native American incarceration, substance abuse addiction and parenting problems lie within the historical trauma that our culture has endured, including:\r\n\u2022\tA legacy of genocide so horrendous that it caused deep intergenerational trauma\u2014separating Indigenous people from their cultures, languages, traditions and families.\r\n\u2022\tA trauma of this magnitude often manifests as violence and addictions, and leads to involvement with the criminal justice system\u2014Incarceration is intergenerational.\r\n\u2022\tA culture of widely held stereotypes regarding Native people, as well as incarcerated people, that discourage compassion and basic human kindness.\r\n\r\nMany First Nations people are now using the term \u201csoul wound\u201d or \u201cwounded spirit\u201d to describe the mental, physical and spiritual consequences the cumulative effect of colonialism, genocide and oppression has had on them as a People. We work to address the overrepresentation of Native Americans in Oregon prisons and jails. This disparity, coupled with the cycle of chemical addiction, violence, abuse, hatred, hopelessness and neglect in Native American communities fuels our commitment to supply transition information, guidance and support to Native American individuals, families and communities. \r\n\r\nRLTS is the ONLY organization in Oregon working to address Native American incarceration through direct treatment programs. The work of RLTS connects with the progressive work of our community, including but not limited to: homelessness, anti-racism work, Native sovereignty, mental health advocacy, anti-violence, child abuse, poverty and social justice issues. While the Department of Corrections budget continues to spiral out of control, the State ignores the glaring needs of incarcerated people: education, treatment, mental health counseling, job skills, and mentoring. Many of our clients have symptoms of internalized oppression; they carry the weight of generational racism and oppressive regimes that have blacked out traditional native teachings and ways of life. We draw upon our ancestors, our traditions, to rise above oppression. By rebuilding a broken strand of our social construction, RLTS\u2019s work with this underrepresented population addresses the underlying causes of Native American incarceration and contributes to the whole system of social change.\r\n",

Native American\u2019s represent 2% of Oregon\u2019s population, yet 27% of the Multnomah County foster system are identified as children of Native American decent. Without prison-based treatment programs, transitional help and post-incarceration support, the vicious cycle of recidivism will continue to effect the youngest members of our community and continue the cycle of dysfunction that plagues our community. \r\n\r\nOur successful collaboration with ODOC\u2019s administration is a critical component for the success of our program. \u201cRed Lodge provides culturally appropriate practices and approaches to rehabilitation that our Native American inmates can't get anywhere else. Red Lodge helps them connect to their better selves and their community in ways that change their lives,\u201d said Emily Brault, Senior Chaplain, ODOC.\r\n\r\nThroughout all of our collaborations and partnerships, RLTS is forging connections to the social movement that is providing hope, support and inspiration for Native Americans that are changing their lives today.\r\n",

Her father was abusive. After he threw her mother out of a third story window, Loretta and her four siblings were taken to Oregon. They quickly fell into the Foster Care System.  \r\n\r\nLoretta got pregnant at 15 and became an emancipated minor. Returning to her mother and tribe, Loretta had three other children. She lived in a domestic violence relationship and used drugs and alcohol to numb herself.  She was soon convicted of delivery of a controlled substance and endangering minors, and sentenced to three and a half years. Her children entered the foster system. \r\n\r\nDuring her time of incarceration, she began fighting and served 13 months in segregation. Her RLTS mentor would visit weekly and talk with her through a six-inch square window in a four inch steel door. \u201cShe was my only visitor, and she made me realize I was capable of being someone different.\u201d Afterward, Loretta went to the Talking Circle, Spring Celebration and Sweat Lodge ceremonies offered in prison. \u201cI felt like a new person.\u201d Loretta did not return to prison as predicted, thanks to RLTS community support.\r\n\r\nRLTS serves an almost forgotten segment of our community \u2013a portion of our community where your men die, your women use drugs, your kids are raised by the foster care system.

Becoming mentors, they exemplify how to lead, how to value the hard work that is to come and how to go forward as a self-respecting member of society. Most importantly, they exemplify how to change: Seven of the RLTS Board and Advisory Members have a history of incarceration and every Board Member and volunteer shares the identity of having family members or loved ones who are, or have been, incarcerated. This fuels their commitment to preventing incarceration by promoting healthy choices, educating, supporting, providing advocacy, and breaking down the systematic oppression that plagues our Native communities. \r\n",

It is the educational sister organization to Equal Rights Washington.\r\n\r\nThe ERW Ed Fund is an outgrowth of Discrimination-Free Washington (DFW), which was an ad hoc coalition formed in Jan of 2004 to mobilize Washington residents to urge their legislators to pass the Anti-Discrimination Bill, House Bill 1809 (which would have provided protections against discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, credit, insurance, and commercial transactions on the basis of sexual orientation).  Ultimately, ERW lobbied successfully for a version of the bill called the Anderson Murray Anti-Discrimination Act which passed in 2006.\r\n\r\nSince its inception, the ERW Ed Fund has provided public education most notably on marriage equality, culminating with a change of public opinion to 53% approval of marriage equality for LGBT in November 2012.  Other legislative achievements of Equal Rights Washington are the passage of the Anderson Murray Anti-Discrimination Act, three installments of Domestic Partnership laws giving legal rights to same-sex couples (the third of which was challenged by Referendum 71), anti-bullying legislation, and the Uniform Parentage Act which helps clarify the roles of surrogate and non-biological parents.\r\n\r\nCurrently, ERW is advocating as a community ally with the Immigration Roundtable for humane immigration reform, with Ingersoll Gender Center to influence the state Insurance Commissioner to include health insurance coverage adequate for Transgendered people, and recently began our LGBTQ Homelessness Initiative.

Our work will raise the profile of the homeless within the LGBTQ community who may not be as sympathetic to the homeless issue as they were on marriage equality.

    "narrative1": "Upstream Public Health (Upstream) was founded in 2003 to improve health and reduce health disparities in Oregon by implementing innovative solutions to prevent the root causes of premature death and disease. We focus solely on preventing people from getting sick in the first place. Upstream advances policy and program solutions designed to change the factors that contribute to poor health - the conditions and places where we are born, live, work, study and play. In other words, the focus of our work is on changing the social determinants of health, rather than working within the traditional healthcare system. We do this by researching the most innovative solutions; educating the public and key decision makers; creating coalitions; mobilizing advocates; and building momentum for change. Issues we focus on include public transportation access, student health, tobacco prevention, dental health, diabetes and obesity prevention, and chronic stress reduction. Because the social determinants of health are closely tied to issues of equity and access for low-income communities and people of color, Upstream always considers the crosscutting issue of health equity in all of its work.  \r\n\r\nUpstream works to build social movements for improved, long-term health outcomes, and has a strong track record as a catalyst for successful policy reforms. Examples of accomplishments include developing policy to require restaurants to include nutrition information on menus, leading a statewide Farm to School coalition resulting in securing funding for state-wide pilot projects bringing farm fresh school lunches to over 50,000 kids in low-income school districts, advocating for improved dental services, and successfully advocating for a health indicator in school district academic measures. Partners include a broad network of individuals and organizations such as grassroots advocates, coalitions of communities of color, health allies, the media, and key policy and decision-makers.\r\n",

We work hard, through a combination of research, legislative advocacy, coalition-building, outreach and education, to advance policy solutions designed to change the systemic conditions  that contribute to poor health. Some key policy issues that Upstream has supported include increased funding for tobacco prevention and cessation services, cultural competency training for medical providers, tuition equity, and paid sick leave for workers.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that we can only effectively advocate for systems that impact vulnerable communities by deliberately engaging them in our work. For this reason, Upstream works in partnership with community-based organizations that serve our priority populations. In fact, we share office space with six different culturally diverse nonprofit organizations.  \r\n\r\nUpstream solely focuses on prevention - preventing people from ending up in the healthcare or what we refer to as the \"sick care\" system. We work hard on the leading causes of premature death and illness. We focus on policy change because it ensures that all communities have access to resources instead of just the lucky few. For example, in order to curb the diabetes and obesity epidemics we knew that we needed to focus on children's nutrition specifically. We began working with local school PTAs and school boards but soon realized that for all low-income children to benefit we needed to focus our efforts statewide. Within a few years of extensive outreach and engagement, our coalition successfully passed one of the strongest school nutrition standards in the US. We recognize the need for communities to grow their understanding of how community health issues impact them and their families, and want to empower those groups to advocate on these issues themselves. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to better engage and mobilize community members into Upstream\u2019s work to improve health justice. The project will develop a regional health equity network that prioritizes local policy initiatives, engages committee members respective communities and builds momentum for change focusing on our mission - addressing the root causes of poor health. \r\n\r\nThis project will enable Upstream to take its community engagement to a deeper level so that we better engage youth and communities most effected by disparities. We will work with diverse community members to prioritize Upstream\u2019s local policy priorities, and build a grassroots network, led by a steering committee comprised of 15+ members. For the past 5 years, Upstream has dramatically increased our internal capacity and working knowledge of how racism and classism impact health. We also have increased our skills, experience, and leadership in health justice issues and coalitions statewide.",

Although Upstream has conducted individual campaigns with significant grassroots organizing components, this will be the first time that we will build a local network focused on grassroots organizing.\r\n\r\nIn the first six months of the project, we will recruit partners to serve on a health equity network steering committee, then the network will prioritize policy issues to work, and mobilize community volunteers to advocate for public health and health justice policy change. A minimum of 15 Steering Committee members will be recruited from diverse communities, with a majority of representation from low-income communities, people of color, and those with chronic health conditions.\r\n\r\nThe steering committee will prioritize local policies based on the community need, impact on health, and political feasibility. The steering committee will also be focused on building grassroots power for health justice. The steering committee will recruit volunteers, conduct letter-writing and phonebank campaigns, and mobilize individuals to testify at local decision-making bodies. Issue areas that the steering committee may prioritize include access to healthy transportation options for underserved communities, access to healthy food options in low-income neighborhoods, and access to dental services. The grassroots network will be closely aligned with the HOPE Coalition and their priority areas. Our grassroots health equity network activities will be supported by Upstream's Health Equity Coordinator, and our part-time health equity intern.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the project will be measured by how many people are recruited and engaged in the health equity network, how many people are mobilized around specific policy priorities, and the successes that are achieved in local policy change.", 
    "narrative5": "Upstream is a steering committee member (and founding member) of the Healthy Oregon Partnership for Equity (HOPE) Coalition, a regional coalition of diverse community-based advocacy organizations whose mission is to create and implement a five- year health equity plan for the four county region of Clackamas, Marion, Multnomah and Washington Counties. Now in year two of five, the HOPE Coalition developed its five year plan through extensive engagement of over 100 community-based organizations.The coalition is governed by a six member steering committee. Steering committee members include Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon, the Center for Intercultural Organizing, the Oregon Latino Health Coalition, Tobacco-free Coalition, Upstream, and the Urban League. Our coalition-building efforts around health equity have contributed to the elevation of health equity as a priority at the state and local level. The HOPE coalition completed an extensive literature review, and also wrote a comprensive 5 year plan to reduce health disparities. However, while this grasstops health equity coalition is vital what's needed is more support and leadership from grassroots health justice community members who can advocate decision makers directly alongside grasstops leaders to move important health measures forward. While it is important to have the consistency, experience, and knowledge from leaders of community based organizations, our movement desperately needs additional voices from the community itself. These voices bring more truth and legitimacy to our efforts and this grassroots committee will deeper connections with local communities which will inform and improve our work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Upstream\u2019s work and the field of public health lends itself to a constant analysis of root causes of social determinants of health, which the CDC defines as \u201cthe circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work, and age, as well as the systems put in place to deal with illness.\u201d We also know that racism is a major contributor to health disparities among communities of color.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Upstream\u2019s staff and board are white, which reflects both the demographics of the region and public health field. It also means that the organization needs to prioritize development of its understanding of how racism contributes to unjust disparities in health to feel empowered as white allies, and to ensure that our internal and external policies and practices in no way contribute to institutional forms of racism and oppression. \r\n\r\nUpstream hopes to achieve this in two ways: 1) By continued funding of the Health Equity Coordinator position and 2) By engaging directly with the community through the development of a regional health equity network that prioritizes local policy initiatives. We hope to achieve the latter through this grant application, and the former is already underway.\r\n\r\nThe Health Equity Coordinator works in part to ensure staff and board have a strong understanding of institutionalized racism and to develop organizational strategies for applying an anti-racist lens to our public health projects. To that end, the Coordinator leads implementation of the Health Equity Work Plan, which was developed after staff and board completed an internal equity audit. It has five components: Funding; Organizational Capacity Building; Hiring/Volunteers/Interns; Outreach and Relationship Building with Communities of Color; and Communication. Each component identifies specific goals, benchmarks, and action items.  For example, each staff member develops annual goals related to increasing genuine, strategic partnerships with communities of color. In addition, Upstream is applying a Race Equity Tool to all its current and future projects. The tool itself is a road map for analyzing the racial equity impacts of our projects and ensures that race equity is infused in our work from the outset.\r\n\r\nUpstream intends to balance this internal organizational learning with the development of a regional health equity network. For the first time in its history, Upstream will invite community members actually experiencing health inequities to its public health policy table.  We believe this will enable us to better analyze and address issues that are at the root causes of poor health, increase the diversity of people at the table who are talking about public health issues, and improve our ability to be strong allies to communities of color and other marginalized communities.\r\n",

RES\u2019 year-round cycle of programming includes a touring Spring Play; summer theatre workshops held in Tribal settings bringing together urban and reservation Indian youth; a two-week performing arts summer camp held at Seattle\u2019s Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Center; and fall performance workshops focused on traditional music and storytelling. Since our formation 20 years ago, RES has mentored hundreds of Native youth and staged over 150 productions, supporting youth access to the intrinsic healing power of Native artistic and cultural traditions which support adolesecent rites of passage while promoting social engagement and academic achievement. \r\n\r\nRES collaborates with and receives in-kind support from organizations like the Seattle Indian Health Board, Seattle Antioch University, EMP Museum, Seattle Repertory Theatre, United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, Longhouse Media, the Seattle Public School District\u2019s Indian Education Program, and the Urban Native Education Alliance\u2019s Clear Sky Native Youth Council.

The common experience of urban Native families \u2013 disconnected from tribal origins, impacted by historical trauma, and living invisibly dispersed throughout a city where Natives represent just 1% of the population - makes for a unique social isolation and cultural loneliness. Building a community to restore ceremony and culture to the center of urban Indian life is how RES is working to heal that loneliness and mend our broken hoop. RES has demonstrated the benefit to providing a traditional arts education to Native students: the students fare better academically and socially than their statistical counterparts. 100% of RES students who were high school seniors in 2011 and 2012 have graduated \u2013 and zero RES students in 2011-12 were arrested, became teen parents, or dropped out of school. \r\n\r\nRES\u2019 Middle School Cohort will consist of up to 25 Native 6th-graders meeting once a week after school at a designated Seattle Public School District location, joining Native teachers from Seattle\u2019s urban Indian community and Drama Therapists from Seattle Antioch University to share a meal, drum and sing traditional songs, listen to and tell stories, learn stage basics and voice projection, practice dramatic improvisation, engage in talking circles around issues important to the lives of our Native youth, and create free public performances integrating traditional and contemporary Native performing arts. The Middle School Cohort will  be  a culturally driven learning community, drawing on our community\u2019s cultural assets and resources to provide our Native middle school students with wraparound cultural support and opportunity for community engagement. Our goal is 25 Native middle school students who all progress academically to high school graduation, are engaged and active in the Native and multi-cultural community, and possess confidence in their Native identities and ability to sustain and be advocates for Native culture. These 25 successful youth will be able to share their ancestors\u2019 stories, will have wrapped their tongues around tribal languages, will be versed in Northwest Native history, will be seen by our community as cultural leaders - and will powerfully demonstrate to the public school system the link between cultural reclamation and Native academic achievement.

Our objective is to mentor and train on specific topics, model good leadership and support the investment of time and resources in each person. Possible topics include Planning, Cultural Competence, and Communications, Facilitation. We will identify members of the community who are willing to champion for the needs of the community. We will create a leadership plan to meet these objectives and provide training that will consist of 2-3 sessions. CNC will reach out and communicate to groups across the Hill. We will strive to create cross-cultural connections and inclusive strategies.\r\nCurrently a community assessment is being done that will provide pertinent information related to the demographic of the community and inform members of the community of the transit impacts and gather their concerns. The data gathered will contribute to learning more about the community concerns and direction of planning and vision for the future. Much will be learned from the assessment that can be utilized to exert influence; including lobbying, influencing the media, supporting political candidates, and voting in large numbers. Marginalized groups lack the resources to exert influence in conventional ways so these avenues will provide a voice.\r\n",

CNC believes that education transform individuals lives. Each program is seen as a success \u2013 KSD has requested that the WYWB be expanded to the middle schools. Student discipline, attendance, and grades have improved. \r\nAlso CNC implemented the Pastor Ride Along program with the City of Kent Police Department. Minority community members are aware that racial profiling and police harassment of racial minorities is common in the area. The combination of negative perceptions and disparate treatment builds mistrust and ineffective policing especially from the African American and Hispanic/Latino communities. The (RAP) brings awareness and solutions related to criminal activity by having local clergy and community members observe youth and gang activity through the eyes of the Kent Police Department officers as they make their patrol at various hours of the day. Members of the RAP have observed officers as they defuse crises and provide feedback upon concluding their ride.

The program open lines of communication between the Kent Police Department and the residents by increasing cultural competence of the Kent Police Department.\r\nCNC is continuing to build community connectedness and cohesion within the neighborhood of East Hill Elementary School. We are working with the school to build a sense of place for the families and residents in the area. Poverty is one main barrier that prevents East Hill residents from becoming more involved in school and community activities. Over 84% of students are on free and reduced lunch. We have held community dinners where over 300 families attended. CNC directly engaged specific ethnic groups and had meaningful dialogue with members of the community. \r\nThe overrepresentation of black students go even higher as the number of days of out of school suspensions decrease, e.g., in the category of 6 to 10 out of school suspension days black students are represented by more than 32% while black special education students represent about 40% of the students being suspended in the special education category. However, African American reading scores in 3rd grade is at 52%. Some states use the numbers of third graders that fail reading to determine how many jail cells they will need about 12 years later. That\u2019s how strong the correlation is between reading and success in school. Considering this fact in the case of the 270 African American students who were in 3rd grade in the KSD in 2011, about 129 of them are already on their way to jail.\r\n",

CNC works to build an inclusive safe community; one that considers the needs of all populations and ethnic groups.\r\nWe continue to collaborate with the Kent School District, Kent Parks, Kent Youth and Family Services to implement Work Your Way Back a suspension program. The intent of the program is for students that are suspended from Kent Meridian High School to serve out their suspensions in a structured and supervised environment. The CNC is attempting to prevent crime by focusing on at-risk youth by motivation techniques and improving academics. Prevention and identification of at-risk-youth may predicate many youth from criminal activities. Understanding, that many students who are suspended are at home unsupervised and are open to criminal activity. Our goal is to decrease poor behavior in schools and provide an opportunity for students to redeem themselves in a more challenging environment.\r\n \r\nWith the support of Growing Transit Communities funding we have began community organizing on the West Hill that covers the cities of Des Moines and Kent.\r\n\r\nCNC has gathered the community by sponsoring several events including National Night Out, East Hill Community BBQ which we fed over 300 members, and we support the community by support other organization events, International Festival, You Me We served over 1,000 community members, KABOOM building of a park.\r\n",

    "narrative1": "We as peers, collaborate with systems and organizations to assist  the previously incarcerated, troubled youth and at risk populations to develop sustainable, productive futures.  \r\n\r\nWe are a grassroots organization, born out of necessity.  Many of our members previously fell into the same pitfalls they observed peers encountering.  They learned the knowledge and skills to redirect their lives to become viable members of the communities in which they live.   They sought to pass this knowledge on.  It began in 2000 with BPC, who implemented 20 correspondence classes for incarcerated inmates with ROOTS (Re-Education Onto Our True Selves).   In 2006, 229 incarcerated inmates registered for the classes.  Many of the previously incarcerated inmates, with community help, sprouted those ROOTS and Justice Works was born.  They helped one another through mentoring, resource assistance and mental health counseling to break old patterns and rehabilitate their lives to see themselves anew.  During 2006, our re-entry services assisted 535 prisoners with these services along with correspondence courses.  Our organizing work utilizes over a 1300 member Action Alert Network.  .  \r\n\r\nA major accomplishment has been the Justice Works Thrift Store.  We have created jobs and leadership opportunities that have given many of our members job skills and confidence to move on to better positions.  Many elderly have donated estate items and our staff have developed lasting relationships with them.  In other collaborations with organizations, such as STEPS, we have begun community gardens.  Members sell produce in low income areas.  We have many initiatives with voter registration, for our clients and the community.   We are working with legal students from the University of Washington who have not only learned community involvement, but have also given them the compassion to know and respect people from all walks of life.\r\n",

We partner with others  in the community to become the voice to the voiceless, to foster change and accountability when inequities are unveiled.  Individuals once in the criminal justice system are many times recycled back.\r\n  Crime exists , and there are many subtle exploitative relationships that benefit from it.  Media in particular receive great ratings when cases are sensationalized.  Politicians and elected officials find ways to champion causes that start or further careers.  Government and private sector have found incarceration very profitable.  There is often big business and hidden agendas tied to institutional injustices and disparities.\r\n  We have a 1300 member action network and growing.

    "narrative6": "We are an organization of minorities at the forefront, but inclusive to all ethnicities.  It is not hard to make those connections because we live them.  Our clients fill the jails, are the last hired and first fired.  They are subtly discouraged from housing of their choosing and sadly too often victims of racial profiling on credit applications, loans and unfair business practices from both small and large business owners.   Clients are sometimes denied adequate healthcare, even with the same medical benefits afforded to their non-minority counterparts.  Immigrants, minorities and the poor are even exploited in the food distribution systems.   Supermarkets are demographically located outside of these poorer neighborhoods.  They are replaced with fast food and mom and pop convenience stores stocked with fatty and sugary food items.  That is why Justice Works has started the vegetable gardens.  To make fresh items available in neighborhoods.  The new racisms have come in the form of divisive systems, economic structures and exclusive institutions.  Above the surface they wear the mask that all is well, but below the clients we service know all too well what lies beneath.   Schools in poorer neighborhoods that are passed over for appropriate funding insisting that taxpayer dollars are divided equitably.  Apathy concerning Infrastructure to roads, traffic signals and stop signs, these all are realities to disenfranchised people of color.  We worked with the community to install voting rights back to incarcerated individuals.  New to the oppression are homosexual men and women.   They now know the sting of being different, and the doors that silently close because you are.    The challenge we present to those in authority and decision making is that we collectively let our voices be heard.  With community involvement, we have worked to install rights and dignities back to individuals (as well as education of those rights) as protected under the law.  Through flyers, emails and town hall meetings, we partner with our communities to redress egregious deficiencies.  Unless their voices are heard, change cannot come.",

    "narrative1": "SAFE was formed on May 1st of 2012 after activists from Seattle attended a City Life/Vida Urbana training because hundreds of Seattle families are losing their homes every month to foreclosure and bank eviction.  This environment is unconscionable. Coming out of the Occupy movement, many local activists came to the realization that the mass displacement of the foreclosure crisis was the tangible way Wall Street was harming our communities. The number one issue confronting working people, women, and people of color in South Seattle was housing.  We set out to organize a community to fight back in a tangible way against foreclosures, bank evictions, and a toxic system that imposes this crisis on us.  In its first year, SAFE has successfully prevented the eviction of six families directly, of Tongan, Somalian, African-American, Vietnamese, Mexican, and European backgrounds through public protest.  SAFE has also connected dozens of families with pro bono legal services, as well as freely given advice and inspiration.  \r\n\r\nFor many facing foreclosure, SAFE has been a vehicle for turning undeserved shame into a culture of defiance and resistance, helping create new activists and community leaders who then assist and inspire others facing a common struggle.  Women especially, who have been told by society and people around them not to be public advocates, not to be loud, powerful and \"demanding\" in public settings, are people that lead our movement.  SAFE has been featured in a variety of media outlets from Real Change (a newspaper of, by and for the houseless community) to Komo 4/King 5 news and the Stranger.  This isn't simply to promote our organization and name, but to promote the notion that we can fight to stay in our homes, that we don't have to \u201cself-evict\u201d just because a bank sent us intimidating letters in the mail.",

    "narrative3": "Foreclosures and bank evictions are the specific tip-of-the-iceberg SAFE was formed to address.  We recognize the long history of economic and racial injustice that led to this.  We raise our voice against the immense political and \u201clegal\u201d powers of financial institutions that claim a right to displace SAFE members and all families in foreclosure.  The Wall Street banks drove the economy into the ground and took taxpayer bailouts because they were supposedly \"too big to fail.\" SAFE members just want to negotiate fair and rational settlements with the banks to stay in their homes. Why will the banks not negotiate?\r\n\r\nWe are opposed to an unregulated casino financial system that put profits before human interests.  In our view, until housing is no longer a commodity, but rather a human right, this crisis will continue.  As long as the problems of unemployment, declining wages, alienation, fear, a broken justice system, a profit-driven healthcare system, racism, sexism, the erosion of hard-won civil liberties, money dominating politics, and the ecology being sacrificed on the alter of economic growth are left unchecked, the crisis will continue. \r\n\r\nWe confront the imposition of shame by banks, courts, and corporate media onto our members, we turn this totally undeserved shame into a culture of defiance/resistance and throw it back towards the institutions and people who are actually responsible.  Families facing foreclosure and eviction tell their stories loudly and publicly, thus helping to destigmatize being in foreclosure as some kind of taboo topic, something to hide and be embarrassed about.  As more and more people speak openly about being in foreclosure and people in the wider public become more aware and sympathetic, the ability to throw people like Dana Ventura out of their homes is weakened.\r\n\r\nSAFE employs the dynamic organizing model perfected by City Life in Boston over the last six years. We use a Defensive and Offensive strategy. The Defense is knowing your legal rights and defending yourself legally. This Defense is used together with the Offense. The Offense is public protest and public pressure on the banks. We are building a radical base that fights to save individual homes while generating a movement to change the whole society. \r\n\r\nSAFE is part of a broader international social justice movement for basic human needs such as clean water. Community leaders have and will continue to spring up, forged in struggle.  Lives of individuals are changed as we fight to change the system.  As victories are won, more and more people will be empowered to fight back, to stay in their homes, and not give up hope. The power of big money will wither away and the power of the \"bank tenants\u201d and their communities will grow.",

    "narrative4": "Our overall short term goals are to create enough public pressure to stop no fault bank evictions and get a moratorium on foreclosures in King County.  SAFE's targeted outreach to families most affected is building a base strong enough to make it happen and our goals are supported by a local coalition led by WA CAN.  SAFE will continue direct action campaigns that win victories for individual families and inspire other families to come forward and fight to stay in their own homes. We turn a culture of shame and \"self-eviction\" into a culture of resistance and defiance. \r\n\r\nOur key strategy is to continue outreach, education, and empowerment of those hardest hit. The true leaders of this movement are the specific families empowered to publicly take a stand against their displacement.  The BTA model designed by City Life gives us a framework to support this leadership with our Defensive and Offensive components. SAFE should be partnering with Harvard Legal Aid, City Life, and other organizations to broaden our legal support with cooperation from Seattle University's Access to Justice Institute and other progressive supporters in the near future. Meanwhile, SAFE's elected grassroots Organizers will continue to plan dynamic direct actions to publicly pressure the banks to negotiate.\r\n\r\nWe will measure SAFE's success based upon the growth of our weekly general meetings and comparing our success this year with the success of last year. Preventing the eviction of 12 new families through direct action and hosting weekly general meetings with more than 80 people in attendance would show that we have doubled our success. Half of these numbers would show that we have maintained our success from last year. A decline would show that we have to completely reevaluate our strategy.", 
    "narrative5": "SAFE is a member of Right to the City National Alliance (RTTC), which is a network of radical base-building organizations across the country.  We participate in coordinated days of action with RTTC similar to the national \"Homes for All\" day of action in mid-March when we called for an end to bank evictions over I-5 with lighted banners shared with SAFE by Vashon Island-based Backbone Campaign.\r\n\r\nOur organization is also part of Washington CAN's Resist coalition, which is working locally and at the state level to call for political change.  In Seattle, SAFE has led the charge using direct action to confront the issue and bring it to the fore. SAFE is hosted by Bethany UCC, a radical social justice ministry of Rev. Angela Ying on South Central Beacon Hill.  Immigrants are a big part of SAFE and the lack of basic rights many immigrants face makes them targets for fraud.  We participated in the March for Immigrant and Workers rights organized by El Comite on May Day.  SAFE views itself as a part of the labor movement, \u201ca union at home\u201d, and especially the environmental movement, as we work to build more resilient, interdependent, and sustainable communities.\r\n\r\nThough SAFE as an organization does not endorse political parties or candidates, we welcome the participation of all people and organizations as long as they don't violate our foundational principles, and encourage local politicians to get involved on the side of the people. So far the Socialist Alternative Party under the campaign of Kshama Sawant for City Council have been very supportive.  As an organization, SAFE has been inspired and informed by City Life's work in Boston.  We continue to communicate closely with them in our common struggle and have been highly recommended by Steve Meacham, a nationally recognized political organizer.", 
    "narrative6": "SAFE struggles for economic justice, environmental justice, housing justice, for liveable communities, and confronting problems that disproportionately affect women and people of color.  We believe it is important that any struggle to confront an injustice in a particular community should reflect the diversity of that community.  No matter what goes on in the halls of power and what race the president may be, without economic justice for poor and working people, disparities created by centuries of racism will never go away.  Even if another racial slur was never uttered and racist thoughts and feeling melted away, America would still have an appalling racial wealth and income gap.  There would still be defacto segregation not only in housing, but also in health, schools, and other public services. \r\n\r\nThat being stated, a study by Douglas Massey and Jacob Rugh of Princeton revealed the extent to which African-American communities have been hit extra hard by foreclosures and bank evictions. It revealed that banks had targeted black mortgage customers for subprime loans and were given worse deals on their loans than white mortgage customers with similar credit scores.  More often than not, communities of color are disproportionately affected by economic externalities that puts profit before life and sacrifice our ecological integrity. Why are certain communities sacrificed while others continue to thrive? This ecological and economic disparity cannot continue if humanity is to have a chance of overcoming the colossal problems of climate change, mass extinction, and resource scarcity.\r\n\r\nWorking class people and people of color deserve safe, healthy, affordable communities. We believe people have a right to environmental justice. This is a right to sustainable and healthy neighborhoods and workplaces, healing, quality health care, and reparations for the legacy of toxic abuses such as brown fields, cancer clusters, and superfund sites.  The right to protection from police, INS/ICE, and vigilante repression, which has historically targeted communities of color, women, people with disabilities and gays and lesbians.  As an organization, SAFE is committed to fighting for the rights of immigrants and supports the demand for full legalization made by El Comite and participated in the May Day immigrants rights march.  We expose and shut-down scam artists and predators that target particular ethnic communities, such as Michael Thompson, a corrupt real estate agent that preyed on Luisa Telefoni's family until confronted with a SAFE direct action campaign.\r\n\r\nOn a weekly basis, SAFE engages in targeted canvassing of families facing displacement in the Seattle area.  We bring families from this ethnically diverse region together in solidarity to confront common problems and build better neighborhoods and communities.   As families from different cultures speaking different languages join, the ability of SAFE to connect with more and more communities grows.",

    "timeline": "[\"Summer 2013\", \"South Park neighborhood  organizing efforts are coming to fruition. Community meetings continue and outreach is being led by local residents identifying with SAFE and directly fighting to stay in their homes. More outreach with progressive organizations and unions to spread the word about the hundreds of families in Seattle losing their homes every month and SAFE working to help generate a movement. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur growth will help SAFE build more direct action campaigns to pressure banks to stop evictions, protest illegal foreclosure auctions, and raise awareness of the systemic crisis. Through these struggles, the victories and even the temporary setbacks, SAFE will grow the wider movement against bank evictions and environmental degradation.  In conjunction with the direct action campaign SAFE continues a campaign of targeted outreach to families in foreclosure and will launch large scale media campaigns to inform and inspire communities to stand up to and fight for their homes. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the biggest obstacles to fighting for housing justice we face is that people self evict, they are not informed of their rights, given a chance to negotiate, and most importantly they don't have hope that they can fight and win.  Fear is the most effective tool of predatory bankers, lawyers, and real estate agents.  No one can stand up to the might of these financial institutions and the complicit courts on their own.  The power of solidarity is our greatest weapon.  \", \"The declaration of unity (petition) is signed by representatives of half of the households in South Park calling for an end to bank evictions and reasonable negotiation with residents. The attempt to evict Jeremy Griffin is thwarted by public pressure and opposition. Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank except Jeremy's lease purchase agreement. SAFE members meet with Sheriff's Department and begin to open up lines of communication.\", \"Fall 2013\", \"SAFE works with WA CAN Resist Coalition to pressure City Council to act. NW Trustee foreclosure auctions, that account for roughly two thirds of all foreclosures and evictions, are disrupted by public protest on much larger scale. Outreach is increased with availability of resources to support canvassing stipends, transportation, and phone lines. SAFE will continue monthly mass demand deliveries to banks in down town Seattle. That is to march to various banks and collectively delivering public letters that tell our members' stories and strongly encourage the banks to negotiate. More pickets will be planned in front of banks that refuse to acknowledge people, as well as protests at auctions. These actions will continue to be targeted and representative of individual families in foreclosure. \", \"Union outreach spreads with Unite Here Local 8 finding members of their local in foreclosure and other unions are approached about checking their rank and file with our foreclosure data and bringing them into the movement.\", \"Winter 2013\", \"We are promoting a culture of resistance where being a target of these predator banks and fighting back against them is not something to be ashamed of and hidden but rather a badge of honor.  We will host increasingly bigger community meetings while building up our network of Pro Bono attorneys and our knowledge and public outreach materials to share with all those who need them.  SAFE will expand it's capacity to stand in solidarity with an increasingly large number of families battling to stay in their homes while organizing them into mass struggles for negotiations, bank tenancy agreements, and principle reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect actions will continue to be organized as case work will become more collectivized as SAFE outreach brings in more families fighting foreclosures with the same banks as other families already active in SAFE. Our weekly meetings should be reaching numbers in which we will have to use the Bethany UCC sanctuary to host. The SAFE office will be much too small for the more than fifty people coming to our weekly general meetings in which we encourage more people to become advocates for themselves and others.\", \"NW Trustee foreclosure auctions are widely publicized in the media and SAFE works with old contacts from OUR WA to pressure the attorney general to insist NW Trustee abide by Washington State laws and end their private auctions. More progressive groups and unions are brought into the effort to push for a moratorium on foreclosure and bank eviction.\", \"Spring 2014\", \"SAFE will do solidarity action with the national networks of local action groups across the country working to build a movement to achieve moratoriums on foreclosure as the United States did in 25 states during the 1930s. Our movement will continue to push for human dignity bringing forward the plight of the house-less and standing in solidarity with the human right to housing.\", \"SAFE will join the King County Coalition to End Homelessness. SAFE's efforts to fight foreclosure will have at least a score of successes in which we have pressured banks to negotiate tenant agreements with foreclosed families rather than evicting and blighting neighborhoods.  SAFE's work inspires the formation of local action groups in other cities in Washington State.\", \"Summer 2014\", \"SAFE's expanded base, with the support of a broad local network of community organizations and activists, will carry out a massive direct action campaign to end Wall Street's ability to evict people from their homes.  Banks will be picketed, foreclosure auctions will be protested on a much larger scale.  Through direct actions, media attention and public outreach, it will be made politically damaging for local representatives not to support the popular demand for direct relief and an end to \\\"no-fault-bank-evictions.\\\"\", \"The King County Council no longer allows the Sheriff's Department to use taxpayer resources to evict families for the banks. Banks and families in foreclosure are seen as having a civil dispute that should be negotiated in good faith. SAFE begins tenant organizing.  Political awareness of housing justice will be strong.  Seattle is moving to a position of having legal protections for bank tenants similar to what has achieved in Boston by City Life/Vida Urbana.\"]",

    "cycle_question": "SAFE considers housing to be a human right. Humans need a safe, clean, and affordable habitat to live in.  We want neighborhoods and communities, that are stable, so people are not subject to the whims of an economy that puts profit before human interests. People shouldn't have to choose between food and shelter. An economy that creates destruction and scarcity must be replaced with a sustainable economy that can support humanity.\r\n\r\nIn Seattle, \u201cgentrification\u201d is also making city living unaffordable for working people and leading to increased occupation of suburban sprawl, when Seattle should be developing sustainable urban communities with mass transit, access to healthy food, public spaces, and meaningful work.  More low-income housing would improve the civic nature and humane diversification of Seattle. The unsustainable pattern of misdevelopment has drastic consequences for nature and humanity. SAFE members are also integral parts of their community.  Foremost, they maintain their house, preventing it from becoming a blight. Vacant houses in Seattle sometimes catch fire while the banks sit on them. \r\n\r\nPeople in foreclosure also raise families and volunteer at schools and community centers. For example, Jeremy Griffin, a SAFE board member currently fighting foreclosure and bank eviction in South Park, was an active leader in the fight for a Duwamish River cleanup. The Duwamish was once considered among the most toxic rivers in the world and now considerable progress has been made thanks to community leaders such as Jeremy. Each time an eviction happens the neighborhood gets less bearable, or less affordable for those who remain.   We lose stewards of the community like Jeremy when the banks choose to evict rather than negotiate.  It was clear to the founders of SAFE that it was time to take a stand for human habitation and fight this morally and ecologically corrupt economic system.",

Our human rights work addresses food sovereignty, workplace rights, and women\u2019s rights; all under a broad human rights perspective focusing on leadership development from immigrant, farmworker, and marginalized Latino families.  C2C is led by women of color who have lived the reality that U.S. history reveals; that people of color, women, and poor and low income communities have been excluded from equitable access to nutritious food, fair wages, and civic participation. Acting on their knowledge and experience, C2C is committed to systemic change that is multi-faceted and complex enough to address the depth of oppression and abuse our community faces.  C2C is the only people of color led organization in Whatcom and Skagit County.  In developing projects with our emerging leaders, we have consistently come up against barriers of structural and institutional racism, deep-seated sexism and heteropatriarchy, homophobia, and structural poverty that we are actively working to dismantle.\r\nIn March of 2012 C2C launched the Campaign to End Racial Profiling in Whatcom County, to take on the work of publicly addressing race and oppression in the Latin@ farmworker community.  On May 5th 2013, we held the first ever Farm Worker March for Dignity, a historic 17-mile march from the rural area of Whatcom County into downtown Bellingham.  By the end of the march, we were a group of over 300 community members, half of whom are farmworkers from Whatcom County.  The March for Dignity represents the growing grassroots power that is being built with the farmworker community and being led by farmworker women, supported by local, state, regional, and national allies.  Our strengths are most visible in our leadership development and empowerment of farmworker women and youth.  This work is done through Cocinas Sanas (Healthy Kitchens) and Raices Culturales Youth Program.  In the last 6 months, Raices Culturales youth participation in Bellingham grew to 25 young people who regularly participate in weekly youth programs, and another 12 young women and men who actively seek out our Healthy Kitchens and Support Group.  At each program, we emphasize the power-building effects of community organizing to end all forms of oppression.  And we are continuing with our commitment to incorporate radical and creative play in our youth and children programming to break through rigid gender binary norms and patriarchy.\r\nWe create culturally appropriate community spaces that nurture dissenting activities and opinions against heteronormative patriarchy.  Our explicit grounding in eco-feminism is a firm base from which we approach our work to end oppression of, and within, the farmworker communities in Washington. At this time, C2C is a rare alternative place to hear and practice dissenting action against entrenched racism, sexism, and homophobia in rural Washington.  \r\n",

In the last 12 months, it is becoming increasingly clear that local leaders transforming the Whatcom County food systems, such as the Whatcom Food Network, are recognizing Latino farmworkers as integral to this transformation.  In partnership with grassroots leaders, C2C has built a momentum that now needs the support of a Projects Manager in order to sustain this momentum.\r\n\r\nC2C Executive Director Rosalinda Guillen has been a member of the Advisory Committee for the National Agricultural Justice Project since 1999 and has worked to develop domestic fair trade standards for farm workers in U.S. based family and medium sized farms. The standards are now complete and have been piloted in several states including Oregon and C2C is a recognized worker organization certified to conduct workplace audits and mediate conflicts between farmers and workers. This third party community based role is key to ensuring justice in the fields for farm workers in a domestic fair trade workplace that has implemented the standards and is using the AJP Fair Trade label in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nEach Project has built-in accountability measures through the Americorps Volunteers Program, the Campaign to End Racial Profiling Program, and the Raices Culturales Summer Institute for Youth Leadership Program.  C2C will measure the success of each program through these accountability measures specific to each program.  Additionally, C2C\u2019s continued leadership within regional and national structures such as the US Food Sovereignty Alliance, the Domestic Fair Trade Association, the Agricultural Justice Project will demonstrate how we have met our internal goals for Food Sovereignty and grassroots Movement Building.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Our work includes a circular programmatic leadership development approach that ultimately leads back from oppression to the creation of socially just solutions that can be sustained by the affected communities. One of these solutions that we strongly believe is the creation of a Solidarity Economy with the pillars of cooperative development and collaborative and participative democracy.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 C2C became a member of the Western States Center\u2019 Strong Families Northwest Cohort and will be a member of the Uniting Communities Cohort focusing on working with LGBTQ-identified people in the Latino farmworker communities in Whatcom County. This innovative partnership has provided training, collaboration opportunities and campaign strategy development to advance gender and reproductive justice in our region. This cohort models the focused ways that different sectors and movements can build shared analysis and action, particularly on the range of ways our families are being threatened and attacked. In many ways, this partnership has highlighted the need for Community to Community to go through an internal assessment and dialogue about how to deepen our commitment to gender justice and ending homophobia throughout all of our work. \r\n\r\nSince 1999, C2C Executive Director Rosalinda Guillen through the Agricultural Justice Project  has worked to develop domestic fair trade standards for farm workers in U.S. based family and medium sized farms. C2C has also been an organizing member and founding member of the National Domestic Fair Trade Association (DFTA), since its inception in 2004 and have won an elected place on the National Executive Board of the DFTA and C2C farm worker members are active participants on the farm worker caucus of the DFTA. Most recently C2C hosted a National Convocation for farm workers in Bellingham WA to introduce local Whatcom and Skagit farm workers and family farmers to Domestic Fair Trade. ", 
    "narrative6": "C2C focuses on human rights work in Whatcom County.  Our human rights work addresses food sovereignty, workplace rights, and women\u2019s rights; all under a broad human rights perspective focusing on leadership development from immigrant, farmworker, and marginalized Latino families.  C2C is led by women of color who have lived the reality that U.S. history reveals; that people of color, women, and poor and low income communities have been excluded from equitable access to nutritious food, fair wages, and civic participation. Acting on their knowledge and experience, C2C is committed to systemic change that is multi-faceted and complex enough to address the depth of oppression and abuse our community faces.  C2C is the only people of color led organization in Whatcom and Skagit County.  In developing projects with our emerging leaders, we have consistently come up against barriers of structural and institutional racism, deep-seated sexism and heteropatriarchy, homophobia, and structural poverty that we are actively working to dismantle.\r\nIn March of 2012 C2C launched the Campaign to End Racial Profiling in Whatcom County, to take on the work of publicly addressing race and oppression in the Latin@ farmworker community.  On May 5th 2013, we held the first ever Farm Worker March for Dignity, a historic 17-mile march from the rural area of Whatcom County into downtown Bellingham.  By the end of the march, we were a group of over 300 community members, half of whom are farmworkers from Whatcom County.  The March for Dignity represents the growing grassroots power that is being built with the farmworker community and being led by farmworker women, supported by local, state, regional, and national allies.  Our strengths are most visible in our leadership development and empowerment of farmworker women and youth.  This work is done through Cocinas Sanas (Healthy Kitchens) and Raices Culturales Youth Program.  In the last 6 months, Raices Culturales youth participation in Bellingham grew to 25 young people who regularly participate in weekly youth programs, and another 12 young women and men who actively seek out our Healthy Kitchens and Support Group.  At each program, we emphasize the power-building effects of community organizing to end all forms of oppression.  And we are continuing with our commitment to incorporate radical and creative play in our youth and children programming to break through rigid gender binary norms and patriarchy.\r\nWe create culturally appropriate community spaces that nurture dissenting activities and opinions against heteronormative patriarchy.  Our explicit grounding in eco-feminism is a firm base from which we approach our work to end oppression of, and within, the farmworker communities in Washington. At this time, C2C is a rare alternative place to hear and practice dissenting action against entrenched racism, sexism, and homophobia in rural Washington.  \r\n",

C2C is working to establish sustainable structural mechanisms to make sure all families and individuals in the community are treated fairly and humanely within the law.  Racial profiling and harassment from law enforcement officers (both Border Patrol and local police departments) are symptoms of the hightened surveillance and alarming criminalization of immigrant communities of color, particularly immigrants from formerly colonized countries, now living in poverty and working in low-wage labor sectors in the United States.  The prevalence of racial profiling by law enforcement in Whatcom County has been systematically documented by C2C staff this Campaign.  These stories of abuse, gathered by and from our membership, show the continued building layers of adverse effect on farmworkers, immigrant families, and low income Latino families; causing family stress, poverty, limited access to civic engagement, family disintegration, inhumane treatment and increased exploitation at work of Latinos and low-wage immigrant workers, continued fear of law enforcement, disenfranchisement of Latino youth at an early age and more.  The Campaign to End Racial Profiling seeks keeps immigrant families together in our community and stop the erosion of the dignity of immigrant workers and their families, by getting the Resolution to End Racial Profiling to end at the local level.",

    "narrative1": "The Black Prison's Caucus (BPC) was founded in 1972 by men incarcerated at the Washington State Reformatory in Monroe.  The men organized Black Culture Workshops between 1969 and 1972 leading to the development of the BPC. BPC has worked for 41 years to improve the condition of incarcerated people, our families, and the communities we come from.  The BPC fosters respect, responsibility, self worth and unity.  BPC is one of only a handful of prison based organizations founded by prisoners in the nation. BPC organizes and hosts workshops and summits on many topics including education, employment, domestic violence, culture, spirituality, entrepreneurship, family support, and criminal justice issues. Incarcerated men and women, public officials, educators, clergy, social service practitioners, and others participate in various BPC sponsored events in the prison.  The BPC has organized a culture of support, dignity, and pride while locked inside the country's most inhumane and oppressive system. BPC meetings are referred to as \"a circle of life\" a model for all organizations to practice emotional healing, self determination and growth underneath the most challenging circumstances.  \r\n\r\nIn 2012 BPC expanded to the Clallam Bay Corrections Center.   Expansion is due to the credibility the men have established as an organization inside the department of corrections and the support we acquired from the many community organizations we are in partnership with.   The latest projects that the BPC is developing are the RE-Entry Assistance Program at Monroe and the Taking Education and Creating History (TEACH) program at Clallam Bay.  TEACH is a higher education program designed to allow prisoners access to a college level education. The TEACH program and the Re-Entry Assistance programs are  examples of how self determination can transform an idea into a great accomplishment that benefits the lives of men incarcerated in Washington State.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The primary issues addressed through this request are education, successful re-entry and prevention.  We are also continuing work to document BPC history. \r\nThe root causes of the issues related to a history of slavery, Jim Crow and institutional bias that has resulted in the current statistics that we see in all of our institutions in this country.\r\nUnderfunded schools and zero tolerance policies are just two issues that propel children into the cradle to prison pipeline.  Statistics show that education is a key indicator of success in life. Race, education and poverty are key indicators of who will and will not end up in prison.  Education is one of the most effective tools in lowering recidivism rates among the incarcerated. We understand how obtaining education creates a strong foundation for success.  Therefore it is imperative that we do everything in our power to create opportunities for people to obtain education while they are in prison if they are to be successful when they are released.  \r\nFor many years BPC has supported individual members to take every opportunity to gain knowledge.  The BPC also hosts education forums, workshops and summits for educators and policy makers inside the prison.  The purpose is to share our experiences with educators in a system that has failed us and continues to fail our children.  We share informed suggestions and examples in an effort to motivate our educators and systems to improve the way they teach our children. These efforts require a collaborative working partnership with our sponsors and other organizational partners who work on like educational organizing efforts.  The summits are one of many examples of how we build upon collective power.\r\nWe also build collective power by the relationships formed with The Village of Hope, People's Institute, Freedom Education Project Puget Sound and other social justice and educational organizations to bring about systematic change.  Through those networks we gain the ability to reach out to policy makers and elected officials to become part of the change that we want to see within institutions. Through the TEACH program we have connected with educators from various colleges.\r\nYouth incarceration rates are rising adding to high unemployment rates among the poor population. The zero tolerance policies and drug sentencing laws are not giving youth many options within the high crime and drug communities that they come from. The need for a strong community is critical for the growth of children coming out of these neighborhoods.  Our work changes the underlying power dynamic by partnering with community organizers to tackle the problem head on.  Our Organizing partners are strategizing and gaining a better perspective from those of us who have been directly impacted by the criminal justice system. \r\n",

    "narrative4": "Our overall goal is to strengthen the BPC.  Our strategies include:\r\n\r\n-Developing the BPC TEACH Program, a higher education program that will offer credited and non credited coursework to men incarcerated at Clallam Bay Correctional Center.\r\n-Developing the BPC Re-Entry Assistance Program at Monroe Correctional Complex.\r\n-Developing plans for a Youth Summit\r\n-Hosting the Annual Criminal justice Summit at Monroe, BPC Family Summits and activities\r\n-Undoing Racism training at Monroe and Clallam Bay\r\n-Increase the number of approved sponsors to enable us to meet regularly and with greater frequency.\r\n\r\nWe will work to strengthen our communication and coordination between BPC Clallam Bay, BPC Monroe, with members who have re-entered community, with our families, with our sponsors and with our partner organizations.   We will work to develop the TEACH program and we will host a pilot of Career Bridge a career and support effort developed in partnership with Seattle government and community organizations at the Monroe BPC as part our Re-Entry Assistance Program.\r\n\r\nWe have an ongoing assessment process through our Circle of Life meeting process. Our goals are written, and we consistently review our progress and fine tune our plan.  Meeting is difficult in prison. The Department of Corrections requires that an approved outside sponsor be present for every meeting.  This is difficult in all prisons but poses extra difficulty at Clallam Bay because we are a 4 hour drive one way from our communities.  This means that people must travel 8 hours to enable us to meet for 2 hours.  We must use our meeting time efficiently.  We are focused on our goals and objectives because we do not have the luxury to do anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Freedom Education Project Puget Sound is a partnership that has been formed to strengthen the relationship of education programs servicing incarcerated women. F.E.P.P.S operates inside the Washington State Correction Center for women and is accountable for a group called \u2018The Village.\u201d  Both The Village and the BPC are using education to change the culture of prison and the lives of prisoners in a revolutionary way.  It\u2019s a program that stands for what\u2019s positive and what we make possible even in the most dire and oppressive circumstances. People can only see a part of this system from the outside when visiting. This collaboration is looking to inspire other prisoners across the country in the direction of a progressive movement towards transforming the criminal justice system and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe Undoing Racism network includes organizations throughout the country working toward racial equity.  The network includes government, churches and faith organizations, school systems, community organizations etc.  BPC's role has multiple aspects.  We participate in undoing racism training as participants, we helped organize and facilitate the undoing racism training process in prison.  We strategize as organizers and we have informed the work of the organizations in the network.  All of the work in some way relates to the criminal justice system. We have been a strong and effective voice in child welfare, education, economic justice and of course criminal justice work because we experienced the oppression of these systems first hand.  We bring credibility, authenticity and above all a sense of urgency to the network.  \r\n\r\nAn unlikely collaboration has developed around re-entry work between BPC and the King County Prosecutor's office. This is a prime example of crossing constituency lines build a broad progressive movement to affect change and improve results.\r\n\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Race matters.  If anyone has any doubts that race matters in this country they should get themselves arrested so that they can see very clearly just how much it does matter.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the criminal justice system and poverty is clearly drawn. People in prison, typically had lower incomes prior to incarceration.  Coming out with a felony conviction greatly reduces their ability to gain living wage employment, thus making an already difficult financial reality a virtual nightmare.\r\n\r\nWe work to help our membership understand and make sense of the things that have happened in our community.  Drawing the connection between race and poverty for decades and across generations, our members begin to understand that when you live in a pressure cooker of stress related to all of the things that come with institutional racial bias, many times emotions erupt, anger gets out of control and since there are few healthy outlets for all of the energy those things erupt in our relationships and in our neighborhoods.  .  \r\nOppression begets oppression in many ways and unless we have some sense of how  the system is broken rather than taking for granted that we are broken we never take the time or seize the opportunity to assess what is really happening and why.  Prison gives us no gifts, but we are determined to use \"time\" to our advantage.  We believe that our clarity about racial justice coupled with action will make significant positive change both here and in the community.\r\n\r\nOur summits both in the prison and for our families in the community are very intentional about helping our families to understand the \u201croot of the cause\u201d so that we can begin to change our realities.  It is very important for our families to see their fathers, brothers, sons, cousins and uncles as men of intelligence, accomplishment and concern.  These efforts are intended to help our communities come to grips with the reality of incarceration so that we can all overcome the stigma and the stereotypes that contribute to the cycle that we are in.  They are also intended to equip our families and ourselves with tangible skills.\r\n\r\nDr. Maxine Mimms is helping us to develop the TEACH program.    Most of us have experienced oppression in the education system.  We are striving to create an example that will not only challenge such oppression but more importantly offer an alternative.  If we are able to accomplish this here with all of our obstacles, there is no reason that school systems cannot educate our children more effectively. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "The work described in this proposal covers just a few areas in which we feel that if we improve in we can make a difference. The Black Prisoners Caucus (BPC) is a prison organization organized and led by prisoners.  We address issues that affect the lives, families, and communities of those impacted by the criminal justice system. The perspective that the B.P.C. brings can only be obtained from those that have experienced social injustice first hand. Not only does that perspective make us effective as organizers, it gives credibility to those we work in partnership with.  A criminal justice  effort that includes people who have been criminalized or placed within the criminal justice system  makes criminal justice reform efforts that that much more powerful. \r\n\r\nAs an organization whose members have been impacted, we acknowledges and accept our responsibility to the community to ensure the work being done and the issues being raised have the influence and power to make a difference.\r\nWe are happy to be in partnership with the Social Justice Fund because it's important that you recognize and bring to the forefront the issues that we live every day of our lives.  \r\n\r\nRecently the Social Justice Fund and many other organizations rallied around a BPC member struggling to succeed in his re-entry efforts.  He lost his job at his school newspaper because of his conviction record.  Because so many people in the Social Justice Fund and other networks took immediate action he was reinstated.  This was important for the individual who was helped.  But it was both tangible and symbolic for those of us who need sometimes to see and feel the evidence of organizing. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of such a powerful network.\r\n",

When word about the new group spread, people around the state asked for activities in thier communities and requsted information about GLBT issues, support for GLBT individuals, and advocacy for GLBT rights.  In response, the social group transformed into United Gays and Lesbians of Wyoming (UGLW), a statewide organization.  UGLW incorporated as a 501(c) 3 in 1999. In 2003, UGLW applied to the Wyoming Secretary of State to change its name to Wyoming Equality to better reflect its scope and inclusiveness. WE then adopted the mission statement set out above.\r\n\r\nDuring its 26 years of existence WE's major accomplishments have been:\r\n\r\nGiving GLBT people a visible presence in Wyoming by working with the media, lobbying at the state and local levels, advocating for LGBT rights, and providing networking opportunities. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Conducting the only statewide needs assessment of GLBT individuals in Wyoming and using data gathered to institute new programs and strengthen existing ones.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully lobbying for the defeat of anti-gay legislation during many sessions of the Wyoming Legislature.\r\n\r\nConducting successful HIV/AIDS prevention programs, and providing free HIV/AIDS testing at WE events.\r\n\r\nForming partnerships and collaborating with other Wyoming entities to promote understanding, respect, and acceptance of GLBT people and increase our constituents' understanding, respect, and acceptance of others.\r\n\r\nWE is governed by board of directors, whose members apply for positions and must be approved by a vote of the entire board.

    "narrative3": "Our organization addresses:  prejudice against the GLBT population, isolation of GLBP people in a conservative, rural state, GLBT rights, and HIV/AIDS prevention.\r\n\r\nHomophobia is the root cause of the above issues. As stated in an Avert article: \"There is no single definition for the term \u2018homophobia\u2019, as it covers a wide range of different viewpoints and attitudes. Homophobia is generally defined as hostility towards or fear of gay people, but can also refer to social ideologies which stigmatise homosexuality.Negative feelings or attitudes towards non-heterosexual behaviour, identity, relationships and community, can lead to homophobic behaviour. This is the root of the discrimination experienced by many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. Homophobia manifests itself in different forms, for example homophobic jokes, physical attacks, discrimination in the workplace and negative media representation.\" (http://www.avert.org/homophobia.htm)\r\n\r\nPeople fear what is different.  Wyoming is a rural state with a conservative population that lacks diversity, as exemplified by Census figures set out below in #5..  A 2010 Gallop Poll named Mississippi and Wyoming as the two most conservative states in the U.S. In fact, in part because they share the same homophobia as \"majority\" groups and in part because they are battling prejudice against their own situation, some group that would seem to be natural GLBT allies are not. A problem is not only joining forces with other groups, but also finding them and working with them to overcome prejudices they may have concerning GLBT people.  Some groups in the state appear very reluctant to be aligned or associated with a GLBT group, even when those groups have been or are the object of discrimination. \r\n\r\nWE works hard to build collective power through personal contact and a positive, non-threatening attitude.  WE stresses the similarities among people, not the differences, strives to show we all face many of the same challenges and  issues, have families, work, contribute to our society and our economy, and are, in most ways, just like everyone else.  WE's board members make an effort to meet and know people from all walks of life and all backgrounds in informal situations, working from the belief that it is more difficult for people to hate or fear someone whose face they know and whom they might even like. Although this approach may seem simplisitc or unorganized, it is one that can change --  and is gradually doing so -- the dynamics of homophobia.  In a state with such a small population, it is also an approach that can work well.  \r\n\r\nWE realizes deep seated beliefs and fears cannot be changed overnight, but person by person, fears can be overcome and beliefs modified.",

Membership in ESPC is the best means for WE to cross over issue and consituency lines to help build a broad, unified, and progressive movement.  A great benefit of membership is that members get to know each other, learn about each other's movements, and form friendly, personal relationships with each other.  These relationships reduce prejudice and teach us all to respect and understand each other's problems.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ACLU Wyoming Chapter is also a member of ESPC, WE and the ACLU collaborate independently of the ESPC.

The other eight are:  PCUN, FHDC, CAUSA, Mano a Mano Family Center, Salem-Keizer Coalition for Equality, Latinos Unidos Siempre, Mujeres Luchadoras Progresistas, and Oregon Farm Worker Ministry.  \r\nCAPACES came together in 2003 to increase the capacity of individual leaders and strengthen the interconnection and collaboration of leaders across organization lines. \r\n This is especially valuable to smaller organizations like Voz Hispana. VHCC takes the lead role for the CAPACES network on organizing Latino voters, youth involvement in our movement and C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez recognition.

    "narrative6": "Racism, classism and xenophobia are the forces that lie at the heart of the conditions which Voz Hispana seeks to change.  The community internalizes mainstream and reactionary messages that Latinos\u2019 and immigrants\u2019 contributions have little or no value and that the Latino community is a drain on society.  \r\nWe see and address the effects of sexism, and heterosexism more internally in our community.  In addition to oppressing Latino gays and lesbians, heterosexism divides families and separates the Latino community from natural political allies in the GLBT community.  Voz Hispana has taken a leadership role in struggle against heterosexism, most visibly opposing anti-GLBT ballot measures, supporting marriage equity, and openly welcoming GLBT participation and allies in our work.  In 2004, some evangelical churches serving Latinos in Woodburn took their first politic role ever and openly supported Measure 36 (banning same sex marriage).  Voz Hispana\u2019s Ballot Recommendations Committee forged as strong position against 36, understanding that the churches might attempt to de-legitimize and stigmatize Voz Hispana.  Voz Hispana and PCUN continue to be branded by some as \u201cgay-lovers,\u201d but our credibility seems to contain the backlash at the level of \u201cwhispering\u201d campaign. \r\n",

We mainly work within the education system, but also look at things that are directly affecting youth like cuts to youth summer programs, youth bus passes, and youth after school programs. Beyond the advocacy we do around education, we work with other students who head our \"Music In the Schools\" branch, a group that works to ensure that the arts, specifically music, remain within our schools. They hold huge fundraisers and work to support music programs as music is something that continues to be cut. Together, over the last year, we have raised over $20,000, sent students on multiple trips to Salem to advocate for higher K-12 education budgets, testified at various meetings including the city council, met with many groups to discuss education related issues, advocated for student feedback of teachers through the student feedback form we have created, lead a nationally recognized campaign against standardized testing, helped organized two walk outs, and as a whole have made huge impacts on the education system and lives of students in our city.

    "narrative3": "More often than not, we are fighting against budget cuts. The root causes of our low budget are federal and state legislation that locks down funding, and Measures like Measure 5, 11, 47 and 50 that were not well thought out, resulting in restricted funding. However, budget cuts only become really visible once the proposed budget has come out in April. Once the proposed budget is out there is not much hope in changing it. Therefore, we started taking trips to Salem in February to speak with our representatives about the importance of funding K-12 education at a higher level. Not only did we advocate for more money, but we proposed changes to past legislation that currently locks money down. In understanding Measure 5, Measure 11, and Measure 47/50, we understand the that our money is very restricted. Therefore, we advocated that those Measures be repealed. We also looked at ineffective programs in our schools like standardized testing that currently, as a result of federal and state education requirements, lock down funding. Therefore we've been talking to our representatives about our concerns surrounding Standardized Testing and have been advocating for House Bill 2664 which, if passed, will require the Oregon Department of Education to call standardized testing into question. \r\n\r\nThis has not only been happening in Salem, but in Portland we are experiencing many proposed cuts to youth. The city's proposed budget had quite a few proposed youth cuts, like the Youth Bus Pass and the SUN School after school programs which we organized around and saved. We organized for students to testify at the City Council Meetings, speak with the Trimet Board, and write letters asking that the city support these programs. \r\n\r\nOn a more direct action side, we have lead an \"Opt-Out Campaign\" encouraging students to \"opt-out\" of their standardized tests. We are sending the message that our knowledge cannot be reduced to a number, that these scores that highly correlate to race and class cannot be used to evaluate us, our schools, nor our teachers, and that again they are expensive and preventing us from funding the most basic things like teachers and music programs.  This campaign has gained national attention and has helped support the House Bill that will address standardized testing. \r\n\r\nThe Music in the Schools crew fundraisers to take on the lack of sufficient funding, raising $10,000 this year which will go directly back into our schools. \r\n\r\nIn all, we use the majority of outlets to send our message out and advocate for youth and education. We tackle the root causes as well as fundraise for our schools. We don't just complain, but advocate for solutions to best support youth. ",

This will include summer recruitment and \"bonding\" for the Union as well as \"Superfest\" the summer concert and benefit show for Music in the Schools. Recruitment will continue into September. October we will have a \"convention\" in which we get all the students together and start educating ourselves as well as creating an education vision for the schools that we deserve. November I see projects kicking off and possibly our second benefit concert. December will be prime time to lay the groundwork for any sort of campaigns or projects that can really kick off after winter break. January we will start to organize to go to Salem and possibly pilot our Student Feedback forms before the end of the first semester. February will be a Salem filled month as we want to advocate for money prior to a budget coming out. March will also be Salem filled and there will most likely be another benefit show. April we'll organize around the Superintendent's proposed budget and start to prepare the next Student Union leader. May elections will happen for the next Student Union leader, as well as Battle of the Bands, and then we'll end the year. \r\n\r\nAssessment of achievement will happen by those who have been in the Union for a while, looking at the amount of money raised and turnout at benefit shows, as well as by the turnout at student union meetings and student's excitement over education.

    "narrative5": "Education becomes an all encompassing issue as there is so much that can be prevented in the case that the entire population is well educated, therefore it's easy for us to work with other groups. \r\n\r\nWe've been able to connect with quite a few education related groups in Portland, as well as nationally. Oregon Save Our Schools has been a strong supporter of our union, as well as the Portland Association of teachers. In bridging the gap between the school district, the teacher's union, and the community, we've been able to bring a lot of issues to light. Oregon Save Our Schools has been really helpful in providing resources and information to us in our work surrounding standardized testing. The Portland Association of Teachers has helped us in creating student feedback forms so students can provide feedback to their teachers. It's so important to have all the stakeholders in education present prior to making decisions, therefore our relationship with these groups has made it possible for students, teachers, parents, and other community members to advocate for education as one unified voice.\r\n\r\nOne of our students went to Washington D.C. and was able to connect with the student unions nationally. We now participate in weekly video chats with students across the nation, share ideas, and work to lead a national student revolution. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, our relationship with Backspace Cafe has allowed us to use their venue for a reduced price and therefore we are able to empower students by setting up live shows, Backspace has connected us with local musicians who students can then performs alongside of, and Backspace has graciously offered their space for us to host Music in the Schools meetings. Music in the Schools would not be possible without Backspace's continued support.", 
    "narrative6": "It's really interesting going to school in Portland as our city remains segregated, and a segregated city leads to segregated schools. This is something that our student union has said is limiting to students in their education. In order to challenge this, we advocated for a House Bill addressing \"inclusionary zoning\". If passed our city could more easily invest money in low income housing in any neighborhood in Portland. As race and class often go hand in hand, an inclusionarily zoned city would help desegregate our schools and would expose our students to more cultures and lifestyles which can only enhance one's education. \r\n\r\nWe publicly opposed the proposal to close two neighborhood schools in a cluster consisting primarily of minority students. We said that these school closures specifically targeted this neighborhood and as a result, primarily targeted black and brown students. The district justified the closures by saying there was such low enrollment we could not fund these schools at a level necessary for operating them. We looked into this argument only to find that in SW Portland there were schools with the same, or smaller, amount of students per school. At that point these school closures seemed purls racist. We fought the closures, going to rallies, speaking at school board meetings, and attending meetings with teachers and community members to discuss the next steps in challenging the school closures. \r\n\r\nStudents in the PPS Student Union have been part of conversations surrounding gender inclusive restrooms. Many of us have been working to garner student support for these restrooms as we want to respect a person's decision to define by any gender they so wish. We know separate is inherently unequal, so we've been asking that students who want to use gender inclusive restrooms have a bathroom beyond the single stalled bathrooms many schools have tucked away. Two of our high schools now have, or are in the process of getting a gender inclusive restroom. \r\n\r\nMusic in the School's main focus is on fundraising to then give that money away to schools that apply for grants.  All high school music teachers in Portland Public Schools are given the opportunity to apply for a grant to help their school. Equity is taken into account when looking at the grant applications. In understanding that money and race have huge impacts on student achievement, there is an \"affirmative action\" aspect of our application that allows schools who need more support get that additional support before a school that is better off gets that support.\r\n\r\nOther actions: \r\n1. Opt-Out Campaign - anti-standardized testing\r\n2. Support for YouthPass & SUN Schools, both programs have huge benefits for low income youth and youth of color",

This survey revealed that the refugee youth are smoking cigarettes at a higher rate than indicated in the first survey. The survey was given to 150 youth, ages 17-25, both male and female. Analysis of the data indicated that 85% of the male respondents are currently smoking. All female respondents indicated they were not involved with any of these activities. The male youth were reluctant to answer the questions regarding drugs and alcohol in fear that this information would be given to their parents. It is anticipated that more accurate information regarding drug use will be ascertained in the pre and post test of the \u201cYour Voice\u201d program. \r\n\r\nParents and community members clearly voiced their concern regarding gang and drug use at community meetings. Parents have come to the Northwest Refugee Office and spoke directly with committees/Board members regarding their knowledge of use of drugs and gang by their children, and their concern and frustration in knowing how to help them. This year a long NWRIS helped 3 male youth that had been arrested for activities involving shoplifting and possibly kids in gang and alcohol and drug related activity. Clearly increasing among the male youth refugees.  \r\n",

Poverty is one main barrier that prevents East Hill residents from becoming more involved in school and community activities.  Over 84% of students are on free and reduced lunch.  We have held community dinners where over 300 families attended. CNC directly engaged specific ethnic groups and had meaningful dialogue with members of the community.  \r\n\r\nThe overrepresentation of black students go even higher as the number of days of out of school suspensions decrease, e.g., in the category of 6 to 10 out of school suspension days black students are represented by more than 32% while black special education students represent about 40% of the students being suspended in the special education category.  However, African American reading scores in 3rd grade is at 52%. Some states use the numbers of third graders that fail reading to determine how many jail cells they will need about 12 years later. That\u2019s how strong the correlation is between reading and success in school. Considering this fact in the case of the 270 African American students who were in 3rd grade in the KSD in 2011, about 129 of them are already on their way to jail.\r\n\r\n",

We know this is an issue and barrier in our community that we must meet and overcome.  We have begun bringing prominent African American Faith Leaders and Community Leaders together in discussion, dialogue, education, and workshop to begin to deal with these issues.  Our Luncheon series provides an opportunity to increase the safe and affirming spaces in our community, support faith leaders in their evolution, heal a community of individuals and families that are hurting, and further educate our community on the experiences of Black LGBT Oregonians. \r\n  In addition to that work we are currently developing programming and resource networking for Portland's Queer Youth of Color both in the housed and houseless community, in and outside of Portland Public Schools. By hiring a youth coordinator we are able to provide increased support to one of the most vulnerable populations in our community. This will support our efforts to dedicate time, energy, and resource solely for the vastly underserved Queer Youth of Color in Portland.This programming will have a concerted effort on being lead by the participating youths in order to empower them by creating their own community and support systems with the assistance of advocating adults, for which there is a dire need.",

QueerZone is a program for queer homeless youth ages 18-24 under the parent organization Outside In. SMYRC is an LGBTQ drop-in center for youth ages 12-24. These three organizations will partner to create a year long advisory council of queer youth of color (with an emphasis on homeless youth). This advisory council will create ongoing community building events for queer youth of color, create a written resource in the form of a zine, and lastly create a survey to address the needs of this community in Portland.\r\n   These three organizations imagine creating a leadership council lead by youth most heavily impacted by racism, homelessness and homo/transphobia. These youth, with the support of Black PFLAG's Youth Coordinator will make a plan to assess the needs of queer youth of color, meeting those needs, and creating a longer-term plan for this council. The council members will be provided with stipends, work experience, and letters of recommendation/support in attaining employment.\r\n  In addition to creating a survey, the youth action comittee would plan and facilitate bi-monthly Queer Youth of Color Family Dinner Nights at SMYRC. On these nights, youth would come together with adult volunteers (queer adults of color) to cook intergenerational dinners. On these nights volunteers and staff would connect youth to resources, provide support and hand out hygiene and food packages.\r\n     Our objectives for the year would be to create a community of youth supporting youth of color.

SMYRC is a gathering place of LGBTQ youth, including youth from various communities of color, and these youth are working toward self-organizing and asking for adult ally support. As a space that practices youth empowerment, the implementation of responsive and youth-directed action for queer youth of color furthers the mission of SMYRC, which \"honors, empowers, and supports LGBTQ youth to change the world.\" Currently around 40% of SMYRC youth identify as people of color and are moving together within questions of identity, race, and racism within the greater Portland community as well as the queer community within Portland. The youth action committee collaboration will foster peer support that follows the youth empowerment model as well as encourages visibility of youth often dis-empowered by society. SMYRC youth are convening an event called Queer Intersections for youth and young adults under 30 to explore intersections of identity, including racial identities, in addition to ability, class, immigration status, mental health status etc. The youth action committee is the driving force of this event.\r\n\r\nOutside In is a social services agency which provides support to homeless youth and free or low cost medical care to uninsured people of all ages. Services include case management, mental health care, transitional housing, employment and educational support, jobs and more. This agency boasts an 89% housing success rate. This program provides weekly support groups, steering meetings in which youth make decisions about the program, social justice workshops, partnerships with other queer organizations,over 5 weekly meetings, homeless youth-led sexual health  workshops, developing and executing Trans 101 cultural competency trainings for staff in the Homeless Youth Continuum and body positive swims.\r\n\r\n",

GJL has grown into an active membership base of over 50 trans* people and their allies who strive \u201cto fight oppression based on gender and sexuality in Washington State and to create a community where trans* people can live their lives safely, true to themselves, and free from discrimination.\u201d GJL empowers trans* activists to make positive social change in their communities through democratic decision making that prioritizes education, leadership development, and grassroots organizing. \r\n\r\nDespite its short history, GJL has the organizational capacity and skilled membership necessary to implement effective programming and events. As the organization has taken shape over the last eight months and started to build its base, GJL\u2019s members have laid out an ambitious agenda for programming and events. To date, GJL has worked with Gender Odyssey to provide trans* sensitivity training in area schools and collaborated with the People of Color Against AIDS Network to address the alarming rates of HIV in the trans* community. GJL has also provided trainings to 15 other social service agencies, government agencies, and medical providers. Moving forward, public events such as Trans* Pride and Trans* Town Hall will become annual events in the community. \r\n\r\nAn important area of policy being driven by GJL members is the removal of trans* healthcare exclusions on a state-wide level. GJL is leading a coalition of LGBTQ groups, including Basic Rights Oregon whose advocacy secured trans*-inclusive healthcare in Oregon, to lay the groundwork on this issue and to see it through to its passage.\r\n\r\nThis diverse mix of public events, small group trainings, policy advocacy, and internal empowerment work represents the essence of GJL and its future.

    "narrative3": "Trans* activists formed GJL to increase the capacity to address the root causes of cissexism, transphobia, transmisogyny and homo, bi, and queer phobias that trans* people continually face. The gender binary, which dictates that people must meet certain definitions of masculinity or femininity, is the primary source of these forms of oppression and is enforced through both subtle and violent means. Rigid adherence to the gender binary in institutions such as schools, hospitals, housing assistance programs, prisons, and government agencies significantly affects those who cannot change their legal identification or safely access public or private spaces that are segregated by gender. Often times trans* people are not able to obtain proper identification, access public bathrooms safely, secure employment, or even find safe housing as homeless shelters are frequently segregated by gender and are notorious for sexual violence committed against trans* people. This gendered form of control is mediated by trans* peoples' intersecting identities, such as their race, ability, age, and class. The inability to seamlessly access societal institutions due to their gender identity and expression significantly impacts trans* peoples' life outcomes, leading to increased poverty, criminalization, and discrimination.\r\n\r\nAs reported by the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS), trans* people are twice as likely to be unemployed as non-trans people and 90% report being harassed and discriminated against on the job. Due to these challenges in the workforce, trans* people are four times more likely to live in extreme poverty with an annual income of less than ten thousand dollars and often engage in sex work and other activities in the survival economy to make ends meet. This economic marginalization and social stigma takes a devastating toll on the community: 41% of trans* people surveyed reported having attempted suicide, 25 times the national average.  GJL believes that these sobering statistics are reflective of the conditions of local trans* communities. Preliminary results from focus groups sampling the Seattle trans* population reflect this immense social and economic inequality highlighted in the NTDS.\r\n\r\nTo address these root causes, GJL mobilizes on multiple levels, including the individual, collective, and systemic levels. On an individual level, GJL empowers trans* people to build the critical analysis, self-care skills, and self-confidence necessary to love themselves, a radical act in a transphobic society. Organizationally, GJL recognizes that power is built from the bottom-up, not top-down. Members of GJL develop a shared theory of change that addresses the root causes of transphobia and prioritizes community organizing and mobilization as a part of a broader social movement to dismantle systems of oppression. This political framework is useful for identifying institutional targets of trans* activism, such as state healthcare laws that discriminate against trans* people in Washington.\r\n",

    "narrative4": "As a relatively new organization, GJL is in its community building stage. With a solid base of over 50 members, GJL is engaging in ongoing recruitment, especially of trans* people of color and low-income trans* people. With significant organizational momentum going into Trans* Pride in June, GJL hopes to increase its visibility and dig deeper into issues the trans community is passionate about. \r\n\r\nWith an increased public profile, GJL will host a Trans* Town Hall in August. This event will be a panel discussion with a diverse array of trans* activists and the audience engaging in dialogue about the history of the trans community, its present conditions, and its future, concluding with action steps to address community problems. \r\n\r\nFollowing a busy summer with a significant public presence, GJL will focus on internal work through the Trans* Leadership Retreat, a forum for sharpening the skills of existing leaders and training new activists. The retreat will be led by outside facilitators facilitating an anti-oppression curriculum.\r\n\r\nIn the next six to twelve months, GJL hopes to further expand its reach on a state-wide level. Talks between multiple organizations have begun about organizing an advocacy day in Olympia in early 2014. Furthermore, current high-level strategy sessions being led by GJL regarding the removal of trans* health care exclusions in Washington will hopefully blossom into public advocacy within a year, at which point GJL will focus on mobilizing the trans* community for the policy's passage.\r\n\r\nGJL is intensely reflective and self-critical in the evaluation of its work. Benchmarks for meeting our goals include calculating any increase in membership, determining the effectiveness of leaders, assessing GJL's public profile and visibility, and tracking significant victories on important issues. This data collection and analysis will be led by GJL's data expert, a trans-identified Masters in Social Work student.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "GJL's goal is to be a powerful force in the growth of a social justice movement for trans* people through community building, education, leadership development, and advocacy. GJL attempts to do this work in a cross-movement and intersectional approach that recognizes the multiple identities and experiences of each trans* person. Centering the need for collaboration as a key step toward building a broad-based social change movement, GJL has worked with groups to attempt to remove healthcare exclusions for trans* people in Washington and has supported economic justice through a statement from LGBTQ Allyship signed by multiple organizations, including GJL.\r\n\r\nGJL is now leading a state-wide effort to remove healthcare exclusions for trans* people by working with the ACLU, Legal Voice, Equal Rights Washington, Ingersoll Gender Center, and other activists in the LGBTQ community. These high-level talks about strategy will later evolve into mobilization to pressure the legislature to enact this policy change. Without the support of other organizations and a broad-based movement, GJL would not be able to tackle this important issue on its own. \r\n\r\nGJL has also collaborated with LGBTQ Allyship to support economic justice. Recently LGBTQ Allyship circulated a petition to urge the Space Needle to fly the Pride flag in June and to demand the negotiation of a fair union contract with its employees that includes a living wage, meaningful benefits, job security, and stronger anti-discrimination policies. Ten groups, including GJL, banded together to submit this statement to the owners of the Space Needle, a move supported by the Seattle LGBT Commission. Only with such strong community support in solidarity with Space Needle workers will the owners be forced to negotiate a fair contract. \r\n\r\nThese collaborations represent starting points toward uniting a diversity of communities into a broad social movement seeking justice for all.", 
    "narrative6": "As a primarily white-led organization, GJL actively engages in ally work to fight racism in solidarity with organizations led and consisting primarily of people of color. GJL has collaborated with the People of Color Against AIDS Network (POCAAN) to do cross trainings on anti-racism work and trans* cultural competency. This relationship between GJL and POCAAN is an accessible means toward the goal of increasing access to HIV testing for trans* people of color, white trans* people, and cisgender people of color. By inviting Gay City Health Project into this partnership, the future of this collaboration will lie in the formation of a coordinated program between the three agencies to increase access to HIV testing for the populations we work with, all of whom are at high risk for AIDS/HIV. This program would also act as a gateway to HIV vaccination clinical trials at the University of Washington for the trans* community and communities of color, led by Ro Yoon, a GJL member who is a trans-identified woman of color.\r\n\r\nThe work being done by GJL and POCAAN takes place at the intersection of trans* and racial justice by recognizing that both the trans* community and people of color are at greater risk for HIV infection than the general population. For example, trans* women are almost 50 times more likely to be infected by HIV according to a study done by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Similarly, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the African American community faces rates of HIV infection that are almost 10 times higher than the infection rate among whites. For trans* women of color the HIV infection rates are higher still. This joint and overlapping community-wide vulnerability paves the road for a natural collaboration between GJL and POCAAN.\r\n\r\nGJL's work with POCAAN is a concrete example of the intersectional approach that is central to our work. GJL hopes to form more natural alliances with groups of color on issues such as the staggering rate of unemployment, discrimination in the workplace, inadequate access to safe and affordable housing, skyrocketing incarceration rates, the criminalization of immigration, and the ability to access affordable health care, all issues that disproportionately affect people of color, the trans* community, and trans* people of color in particular. \r\n",

    "narrative1": "SAFE was formed on May 1st of 2012 after activists from Seattle attended a City Life/Vida Urbana training because hundreds of Seattle families are losing their homes every month to foreclosure and bank eviction.  This environment is unconscionable. Coming out of the Occupy movement, many local activists came to the realization that the mass displacement of the foreclosure crisis was the tangible way Wall Street was harming our communities. The number one issue confronting working people, women, and people of color in South Seattle was housing.  We set out to organize a community to fight back in a tangible way against foreclosures, bank evictions, and a toxic system that imposes this crisis on us.  In its first year, SAFE has successfully prevented the eviction of six families directly, of Tongan, Somalian, African-American, Vietnamese, Mexican, and European backgrounds through public protest.  SAFE has also connected dozens of families with pro bono legal services, as well as freely given advice and inspiration.  \r\n\r\nFor many facing foreclosure, SAFE has been a vehicle for turning undeserved shame into a culture of defiance and resistance, helping create new activists and community leaders who then assist and inspire others facing a common struggle.  Women especially, who have been told by society and people around them not to be public advocates, not to be loud, powerful and \"demanding\" in public settings, are people that lead our movement.  SAFE has been featured in a variety of media outlets from Real Change (a newspaper of, by and for the houseless community) to Komo 4/King 5 news and the Stranger.  This isn't simply to promote our organization and name, but to promote the notion that we can fight to stay in our homes, that we don't have to \u201cself-evict\u201d just because a bank sent us intimidating letters in the mail.",

We raise our voice against the immense political and \u201clegal\u201d powers of financial institutions that claim a right to displace SAFE members and all families in foreclosure.  The Wall Street banks drove the economy into the ground and took taxpayer bailouts because they were supposedly \"too big to fail.\" SAFE members just want to negotiate fair and rational settlements with the banks to stay in their homes. Why will the banks not negotiate?\r\n\r\nWe are opposed to an unregulated casino financial system that put profits before human interests.  In our view, until housing is no longer a commodity, but rather a human right, this crisis will continue.  As long as the problems of unemployment, declining wages, alienation, fear, a broken justice system, a profit-driven healthcare system, racism, sexism, the erosion of hard-won civil liberties, money dominating politics, and the ecology being sacrificed on the alter of economic growth are left unchecked, the crisis will continue. \r\n\r\nWe confront the imposition of shame by banks, courts, and corporate media onto our members, we turn this totally undeserved shame into a culture of defiance/resistance and throw it back towards the institutions and people who are actually responsible.  Families facing foreclosure and eviction tell their stories loudly and publicly, thus helping to destigmatize being in foreclosure as some kind of taboo topic, something to hide and be embarrassed about.  As more and more people speak openly about being in foreclosure and people in the wider public become more aware and sympathetic, the ability to throw people like Dana Ventura out of their homes is weakened.\r\n\r\nSAFE employs the dynamic organizing model perfected by City Life in Boston over the last six years. We use a Defensive and Offensive strategy. The Defense is knowing your legal rights and defending yourself legally. This Defense is used together with the Offense. The Offense is public protest and public pressure on the banks. We are building a radical base that fights to save individual homes while generating a movement to change the whole society. \r\n\r\nSAFE is part of a broader international social justice movement for basic human needs such as clean water. Community leaders have and will continue to spring up, forged in struggle.  Lives of individuals are changed as we fight to change the system.  As victories are won, more and more people will be empowered to fight back, to stay in their homes, and not give up hope. The power of big money will wither away and the power of the \"bank tenants\u201d and their communities will grow.",

SAFE's targeted outreach to families most affected is building a base strong enough to make it happen and our goals are supported by a local coalition led by WA CAN.  SAFE will continue direct action campaigns that win victories for individual families and inspire other families to come forward and fight to stay in their own homes. We turn a culture of shame and \"self-eviction\" into a culture of resistance and defiance. \r\n\r\nOur key strategy is to continue outreach, education, and empowerment of those hardest hit. The true leaders of this movement are the specific families empowered to publicly take a stand against their displacement.  The BTA model designed by City Life gives us a framework to support this leadership with our Defensive and Offensive components. SAFE should be partnering with Harvard Legal Aid, City Life, and other organizations to broaden our legal support with cooperation from Seattle University's Access to Justice Institute and other progressive supporters in the near future. Meanwhile, SAFE's elected grassroots Organizers will continue to plan dynamic direct actions to publicly pressure the banks to negotiate.\r\n\r\nWe will measure SAFE's success based upon the growth of our weekly general meetings and comparing our success this year with the success of last year. Preventing the eviction of 12 new families through direct action and hosting weekly general meetings with more than 80 people in attendance would show that we have doubled our success. Half of these numbers would show that we have maintained our success from last year. A decline would show that we have to completely reevaluate our strategy.",

In Seattle, SAFE has led the charge using direct action to confront the issue and bring it to the fore. SAFE is hosted by Bethany UCC, a radical social justice ministry of Rev.

SAFE views itself as a part of the labor movement, \u201ca union at home\u201d, and especially the environmental movement, as we work to build more resilient, interdependent, and sustainable communities.\r\n\r\nThough SAFE as an organization does not endorse political parties or candidates, we welcome the participation of all people and organizations as long as they don't violate our foundational principles, and encourage local politicians to get involved on the side of the people. So far the Socialist Alternative Party under the campaign of Kshama Sawant for City Council have been very supportive.  As an organization, SAFE has been inspired and informed by City Life's work in Boston.  We continue to communicate closely with them in our common struggle and have been highly recommended by Steve Meacham, a nationally recognized political organizer.", 
    "narrative6": "SAFE struggles for economic justice, environmental justice, housing justice, for liveable communities, and confronting problems that disproportionately affect women and people of color.  We believe it is important that any struggle to confront an injustice in a particular community should reflect the diversity of that community.  No matter what goes on in the halls of power and what race the president may be, without economic justice for poor and working people, disparities created by centuries of racism will never go away.  Even if another racial slur was never uttered and racist thoughts and feeling melted away, America would still have an appalling racial wealth and income gap.  There would still be defacto segregation not only in housing, but also in health, schools, and other public services. \r\n\r\nThat being stated, a study by Douglas Massey and Jacob Rugh of Princeton revealed the extent to which African-American communities have been hit extra hard by foreclosures and bank evictions. It revealed that banks had targeted black mortgage customers for subprime loans and were given worse deals on their loans than white mortgage customers with similar credit scores.  More often than not, communities of color are disproportionately affected by economic externalities that puts profit before life and sacrifice our ecological integrity. Why are certain communities sacrificed while others continue to thrive? This ecological and economic disparity cannot continue if humanity is to have a chance of overcoming the colossal problems of climate change, mass extinction, and resource scarcity.\r\n\r\nWorking class people and people of color deserve safe, healthy, affordable communities. We believe people have a right to environmental justice. This is a right to sustainable and healthy neighborhoods and workplaces, healing, quality health care, and reparations for the legacy of toxic abuses such as brown fields, cancer clusters, and superfund sites.  The right to protection from police, INS/ICE, and vigilante repression, which has historically targeted communities of color, women, people with disabilities and gays and lesbians.  As an organization, SAFE is committed to fighting for the rights of immigrants and supports the demand for full legalization made by El Comite and participated in the May Day immigrants rights march.  We expose and shut-down scam artists and predators that target particular ethnic communities, such as Michael Thompson, a corrupt real estate agent that preyed on Luisa Telefoni's family until confronted with a SAFE direct action campaign.\r\n\r\nOn a weekly basis, SAFE engages in targeted canvassing of families facing displacement in the Seattle area.  We bring families from this ethnically diverse region together in solidarity to confront common problems and build better neighborhoods and communities.   As families from different cultures speaking different languages join, the ability of SAFE to connect with more and more communities grows.",

Community meetings continue and outreach is being led by local residents identifying with SAFE and directly fighting to stay in their homes. More outreach with progressive organizations and unions to spread the word about the hundreds of families in Seattle losing their homes every month and SAFE working to help generate a movement. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur growth will help SAFE build more direct action campaigns to pressure banks to stop evictions, protest illegal foreclosure auctions, and raise awareness of the systemic crisis. Through these struggles, the victories and even the temporary setbacks, SAFE will grow the wider movement against bank evictions and environmental degradation.  In conjunction with the direct action campaign SAFE continues a campaign of targeted outreach to families in foreclosure and will launch large scale media campaigns to inform and inspire communities to stand up to and fight for their homes. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the biggest obstacles to fighting for housing justice we face is that people self evict, they are not informed of their rights, given a chance to negotiate, and most importantly they don't have hope that they can fight and win.  Fear is the most effective tool of predatory bankers, lawyers, and real estate agents.  No one can stand up to the might of these financial institutions and the complicit courts on their own.  The power of solidarity is our greatest weapon.  \", \"The declaration of unity (petition) is signed by representatives of half of the households in South Park calling for an end to bank evictions and reasonable negotiation with residents. The attempt to evict Jeremy Griffin is thwarted by public pressure and opposition. Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank except Jeremy's lease purchase agreement. SAFE members meet with Sheriff's Department and begin to open up lines of communication.\", \"Fall 2013\", \"SAFE works with WA CAN Resist Coalition to pressure City Council to act. NW Trustee foreclosure auctions, that account for roughly two thirds of all foreclosures and evictions, are disrupted by public protest on much larger scale. Outreach is increased with availability of resources to support canvassing stipends, transportation, and phone lines. SAFE will continue monthly mass demand deliveries to banks in down town Seattle. That is to march to various banks and collectively delivering public letters that tell our members' stories and strongly encourage the banks to negotiate. More pickets will be planned in front of banks that refuse to acknowledge people, as well as protests at auctions. These actions will continue to be targeted and representative of individual families in foreclosure. \", \"Union outreach spreads with Unite Here Local 8 finding members of their local in foreclosure and other unions are approached about checking their rank and file with our foreclosure data and bringing them into the movement.\", \"Winter 2013\", \"We are promoting a culture of resistance where being a target of these predator banks and fighting back against them is not something to be ashamed of and hidden but rather a badge of honor.  We will host increasingly bigger community meetings while building up our network of Pro Bono attorneys and our knowledge and public outreach materials to share with all those who need them.  SAFE will expand it's capacity to stand in solidarity with an increasingly large number of families battling to stay in their homes while organizing them into mass struggles for negotiations, bank tenancy agreements, and principle reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect actions will continue to be organized as case work will become more collectivized as SAFE outreach brings in more families fighting foreclosures with the same banks as other families already active in SAFE. Our weekly meetings should be reaching numbers in which we will have to use the Bethany UCC sanctuary to host. The SAFE office will be much too small for the more than fifty people coming to our weekly general meetings in which we encourage more people to become advocates for themselves and others.\", \"NW Trustee foreclosure auctions are widely publicized in the media and SAFE works with old contacts from OUR WA to pressure the attorney general to insist NW Trustee abide by Washington State laws and end their private auctions. More progressive groups and unions are brought into the effort to push for a moratorium on foreclosure and bank eviction.\", \"Spring 2014\", \"SAFE will do solidarity action with the national networks of local action groups across the country working to build a movement to achieve moratoriums on foreclosure as the United States did in 25 states during the 1930s. Our movement will continue to push for human dignity bringing forward the plight of the house-less and standing in solidarity with the human right to housing.\", \"SAFE will join the King County Coalition to End Homelessness. SAFE's efforts to fight foreclosure will have at least a score of successes in which we have pressured banks to negotiate tenant agreements with foreclosed families rather than evicting and blighting neighborhoods.  SAFE's work inspires the formation of local action groups in other cities in Washington State.\", \"Summer 2014\", \"SAFE's expanded base, with the support of a broad local network of community organizations and activists, will carry out a massive direct action campaign to end Wall Street's ability to evict people from their homes.  Banks will be picketed, foreclosure auctions will be protested on a much larger scale.  Through direct actions, media attention and public outreach, it will be made politically damaging for local representatives not to support the popular demand for direct relief and an end to \\\"no-fault-bank-evictions.\\\"\", \"The King County Council no longer allows the Sheriff's Department to use taxpayer resources to evict families for the banks. Banks and families in foreclosure are seen as having a civil dispute that should be negotiated in good faith. SAFE begins tenant organizing.  Political awareness of housing justice will be strong.  Seattle is moving to a position of having legal protections for bank tenants similar to what has achieved in Boston by City Life/Vida Urbana.\"]",

    "cycle_question": "SAFE considers housing to be a human right. Humans need a safe, clean, and affordable habitat to live in.  We want neighborhoods and communities, that are stable, so people are not subject to the whims of an economy that puts profit before human interests. People shouldn't have to choose between food and shelter. An economy that creates destruction and scarcity must be replaced with a sustainable economy that can support humanity.\r\n\r\nIn Seattle, \u201cgentrification\u201d is also making city living unaffordable for working people and leading to increased occupation of suburban sprawl, when Seattle should be developing sustainable urban communities with mass transit, access to healthy food, public spaces, and meaningful work.  More low-income housing would improve the civic nature and humane diversification of Seattle. The unsustainable pattern of misdevelopment has drastic consequences for nature and humanity. SAFE members are also integral parts of their community.  Foremost, they maintain their house, preventing it from becoming a blight. Vacant houses in Seattle sometimes catch fire while the banks sit on them. \r\n\r\nPeople in foreclosure also raise families and volunteer at schools and community centers. For example, Jeremy Griffin, a SAFE board member currently fighting foreclosure and bank eviction in South Park, was an active leader in the fight for a Duwamish River cleanup. The Duwamish was once considered among the most toxic rivers in the world and now considerable progress has been made thanks to community leaders such as Jeremy. Each time an eviction happens the neighborhood gets less bearable, or less affordable for those who remain.   We lose stewards of the community like Jeremy when the banks choose to evict rather than negotiate.  It was clear to the founders of SAFE that it was time to take a stand for human habitation and fight this morally and ecologically corrupt economic system.",

In 2008, FEEST began under the King County Food Fitness Initiative (KCFFI) which sought community / policy driven solutions to health inequities in the Delridge and White Center communities. Originally at Youngstown Cultural Arts Center, our dinners now occur at Chief Sealth and Evergreen High Schools.  FEEST has fed over 1,300 youth and adults, trained over 43 interns and held 200+ potlucks and dinners. Each year, FEEST hires interns to lead and promote weekly dinners, who are trained as community leaders and advocates. FEEST creates the platform for young people to engage directly with policy development and systems change. FEEST is a proven model for authentic youth participation in underserved communities around the issues of community health and equity.\r\n\r\nFEEST Interns led 3 taste tests in 2 different school districts in coordination with nutrition services directors engaging over 600 students to share feedback with district nutrition services directors. Three new school food items in the Seattle School District were implemented as a result.\r\n\r\nFEEST Interns created salad bar safety educational tool kit in collaboration with the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), Washington State Department of Health (WSDH)  which included a video, posters and a list of recommendations on how to make salad bars more accessible to students.

The issues around health inequity are deeply connected to poverty, race and education. Sixty percent of children at 75% of White Center Schools are eligible for free or reduced price meals, which is three times higher than the King County average.\r\n\r\nFEEST seeks to create greater community health and equity.  FEEST youth identified improving school lunch as the single most important thing we could do to improve access to healthy food for youth in the community.  Our youth interns said from their experience many of their peers get 100% of their meals during school and if we could improve the meals at school we could change a lot of young people\u2019s lives. We feel the school food should reflect the cultural diversity of the community, be fresh, delicious and of high quality. Most of the youth we\u2019ve spoken to describe school food as \u201cgross\u201d or \"nasty\", while nutrition services feels the program is successful.

These assessments will be created and dispensed to in coordination with students, teachers, administrators, nutrition services and other community organizations to over 400 students at the 3 small schools at the Evergreen High School Campus.

RFPC develops just and integrated policy and action recommendations that promote health, sustain and strengthen the local and regional food system, and engage and partner with agriculture, business, communities and governments in the four-county region.  The Healthy King County Coalition is working to reduce health inequities, ensure healthy and affordable food, access to physical activity, and decrease smoking and other tobacco use.\r\n\r\nFEEST is a voting member with both groups. Most of the people sitting on this bodies come from large institutions with little on the ground experience with community. FEEST's  presence ensures youth needs and experiences influence the work of the RFPC and HKCC so policy and action recommendations reflect the desires of the communities we serve. Our presence also allows us to build stronger networks within the food justice movement and be at the table for collaborations, important advocacy opportunities, and  policy discussions that have great impact on the current health in our communities.\r\n\r\nOn the ground collaborations within school have been essential to the viability and the growth of our program.  FEEST works very closely with administrators, service providers and teachers from Evergreen High School and Chief Sealth High School as well as after-school providers such as the YMCA and the Community Schools Collaboration.  By working alongside staff champions who recognize the quality of our programming, we build trustworthy networks that multiply the educational reach of after school providers and teachers.  We\u2019ve created unique food/leadership curriculums for classroom teachers at Chief Sealth that double as outreach.  \r\n\r\nFEEST recognizes our youth intern projects as powerful community collaborations.

We feel that POC adults from the neighborhood, training primarily youth of color, who subsequently go on to lead direct action of their own design in their own communities is both a natural remedy to historicized oppression and a direct-action redress of institutionalized power.  \r\n\r\nFEEST embeds liberatory practice into the fundamental tenets all of our programmatic work.

    "cycle_question": "We believe creating greater community health and equity is deeply tied to environmental justice.   Built environment largely  determine our access to food and economic resources, our health outcomes and often our life expectancy.  Great disparities in health outcomes from one neighborhood to the next occur along fault lines largely correlated with income and race. Thus, the FEEST framework for environmental justice is over arching: alongside the push towards healthy sustainable food, we also envision environmental justice to account for wherever a FEEST is taking place.  Environmental justice includes a safe space place to live, a life free from oppression, clean neighborhoods with decent housing.  In this way, urban communities have the same stake in the environmental movement as do rural communities and vice versa.  Solidarity across distant elements of the food system is essential for leveraging change at scale.\r\n\r\nThe FEEST vision of environmental justice begins with young people asking questions about what they are eating and where the food on their plate comes from.  Subsequent to awakening to food choices in our own lives, we eventually see as our lives are necessarily intertwined with global  food production sustainability and food security.  Our project first seeks to improve access to healthier, delicious and culturally appropriate foods in school lunch and build a pipeline between students and the people who make the decisions about what foods youth are being served.  Once we begin to make these connections along the lines of school food - we can then begin to ask questions of school food sourcing, then on to questions surrounding labor practices, environmental impact and the globalized food distribution network and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We work to create opportunities for meaningful participation in decision-making and build power to address root causes of environmental racism and oppression. OPAL is the preeminent grassroots environmental justice organization in Portland metro, with long-standing relationships in the community and a track record of successful movement building and organizing. In 2010, after having carried air quality and asthma education and outreach to East Portland communities, OPAL transitioned to a Transit Justice and Health Equity program to respond to the community\u2019s critical needs and priorities. OPAL\u2019s Bus Riders Unite program is a membership-driven campaign to mobilize transit-dependent riders to advocate for equitable investments and opportunities for meaningful public participation decision-making. After more than three years of grassroots community organizing and campaign prioritization, OPAL has built a BRU membership base with a core of committed leaders and approximately 50 dues-paying members, with over 35 organizational allies in the region. Poised to win our first Campaign for a Fair Transfer (extending transfer times to three hours), having assessed over 100 bus stops in East Portland, and building a region-wide coalition for preserving and extending YouthPass, OPAL is on the verge of taking the next big step.\r\n\r\nMajor accomplishments:\r\n\u2022\tWon TriMet commitment to establish Transit Equity Committee\r\n\u2022\tPreserved ability to make round-trip transfers during 2012 TriMet budget cut negotiations\r\n\u2022\tSecured $1M from TriMet\u2019s Contingency Fund to establish a low-income rider mitigation program to offset fare hikes\r\n\u2022\tDeveloped BRU Budget Alternative to propose transit-rider endorsed budget priorities\r\n\u2022\tMember of Transit Riders for Public Transportation coalition to advocate for federal public transit and Civil Rights restoration\r\n\u2022\tFounding member and current vice-chair of Governor's Task Force on Environmental Justice\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "TriMet (Portland\u2019s transit authority) is lauded as a national model for progressive transportation, largely due to the region's light-rail (MAX) system, which receives the majority of federal, state and local resources, while core bus service is consistently cut. Rail development has largely benefited more affluent commuters and those fortunate to live near the service. Transit riders that rely predominantly on the bus have been negatively impacted, jeopardizing the health equity of our region. We have a clear two-caste system, with 21st Century rail and 20th Century bus, and with transit-dependent riders unable to keep pace with annual fare hikes.\r\n\r\nDespite recent demographic changes in the region, this power imbalance persists. As part of the FY13 budget, the TriMet board approved an historic fare hike, cut bus service for the fifth straight year and eliminated the Free Rail zone. A majority of all cash/ticket TriMet boardings (56%) are now made by transit-dependent riders, with a disproportionate number of people of color given their relative lack of access to personal automobiles (32% v. 19%). People of color and low-income are also more likely to transfer between lines, meaning longer wait times and more missed connections. Compounding these disparities is an agency that is neither transparent nor accountable to its riders. There are no transit-dependent riders on the TriMet Board (and only one regular rider!), who are appointed by the Governor with no public input, and no meaningful process to engage riders in fundamental and critical decisions.\r\n\r\nOPAL\u2019s strategy to change this unjust dynamic is to institutionalize Bus Riders Unite and build power with transit-dependent riders to influence decision-making. Over the past three years, OPAL has built the BRU membership and social capital through grassroots organizing, education and leadership development. BRU forced TriMet to change their practice so as to allow public comment before making decisions (as opposed to relegating all testimony to the general public comment period at the end of meetings). TriMet\u2019s board and staff are increasingly aware of the need for a greater focus on transit equity, publicly agreeing to OPAL\u2019s proposal for a standing Transit Equity Committee made up of transit-dependent riders.\r\n\r\nOPAL\u2019s primary goal is to facilitate and support members to take greater ownership of BRU. We recently concluded our first BRU Membership Retreat, establishing formal rules and decision-making, membership criteria and leadership structure, subcommittees and priorities, a recruitment, orientation and retention strategy, a grassroots fundraising strategy, and a timeline for finalizing this transition of BRU from OPAL staff to the leaders and members. Through leadership development, BRU will have a leading role in TriMet's Transit Equity Committee, influencing the decision-making of its Board through public testimony and direct action, and changing the narrative for our region.",

The current proposal includes: electing BRU leadership committee, establishing a budget, prioritizing our next campaign issues, establishing subcommittees and regular meeting schedules, recruiting, orienting and retaining new members, conducting organizing and campaign trainings, initiating direct actions and building partnerships. Current campaigns includes the Campaign for a Fair Transfer (extending transfer times to three hours during the day and through the evening for boardings after 7pm), the East Portland Bus Stop Project (assessing and prioritizing East Portland bus stops for improvements), and YouthPass (providing free transit passes for high school students).\r\n\r\nOPAL and BRU are closing in on a win for our Campaign for a Fair Transfer, as TriMet officials consider including a commitment in their FY14 budget narrative. We have assessed over 100 bus stops in East Portland and will facilitate the community prioritization meeting on May 14th, followed by advocacy to allocate funding to make the prioritized improvements. And we have won a reprieve for YouthPass, which TriMet, the City and Portland Public extended for one more year, buying us time to build a broader coalition in partnership with the Multnomah Youth Commission to refine and institutionalize the current program with sustained funding and extend it out to East Portland school districts.\r\n\r\nBut our real evaluation of success will come with the degree to which our BRU membership structure takes hold. Success will mean a smooth adoption of the membership structure proposal, the transition from our interim leadership to an elected leadership, the development of our subcommittee work, consistent monthly meetings that are led by leadership, and a growing base of transit riders who remain engaged in our collective action and advocacy.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "OPAL is a leading and founding member of Connecting Communities of Oregon, working to repeal statewide prohibition on the use of mandatory inclusionary zoning, an important land use tool to promote mixed-income housing development and housing mobility and opportunity. OPAL's role is to facilitate the coalition, broaden its reach throughout the state, and connect non-traditional partners to fight for housing justice, making the connection between housing, transportation and health outcomes. Through this work, OPAL is also part of another statewide effort, the Racial Equity Report Card coalition, facilitated by the Western States Center, to track and influence legislation with strong racial equity outcomes. OPAL's legislation to repeal the prohibition on inclusive housing is one of the bills being tracked by the Racial Equity Report Card, ensuring that the racial equity impacts of this effort do not go unnoticed. These efforts facilitate an awareness around the intersectionality of our shared work, as we raise awareness of the impacts to both communities of color and low-income communities, and the integration of housing, transportation, economic opportunity and health. Taking these principles from statewide advocacy to on-the-ground organizing, OPAL is also a member of the Aloha Unite coalition, working with the Center for Intercultural Organizing and other organizations in unincorporated Washington County to bring communities of color, immigrants and low-income families into County planning processes to ensure that their voices and priorities are heard and met. OPAL's role is to provide transit justice advocacy along with education on the \"Sustainable Communities\" approach of integrating the housing, transportation, jobs and health equity planning.",

Environmental health inequities persist due to institutional discrimination, exclusionary policies and practices, and tokenism. OPAL works to dismantle oppressive structures within our organization by intentionally being led by those who are most impacted by environmental injustice. OPAL\u2019s campaign work is driven by people of color and working-class people, our Bus Riders Unite transit justice work is driven by those who are transit-dependent, and all our grassroots organizing intentionally targets low-income families and communities of color in outreach and engagement and leadership opportunities. We strive to have an organization and structure representative of the communities within which we work, and are majority POC-led (though currently the Executive Director is white). Our board is 50% POC, our staff is 60% POC, our core leadership is 60% POC, and our membership is approximately 40% POC. However, we are multi-racial, with an overarching focus on working with low-income people, regardless of race, and as such, attract a lot of poor white members, as well as more privileged white allies. We use that opportunity to educate our members and allies around the history of Civil Rights and environmental justice, and on the importance of racial justice, while adhering to our value that all movements against oppression are united.",

    "cycle_question": "Both environmental justice and transportation justice came out of the Civil Rights movement. Dr. King focused on transportation access early on in his work, and transportation inequities - including both the disproportionate funding of our freeway infrastructure as well as the disparate funding to operate urban public transit systems - have been well documented by academics (Dr. Bullard) and activists (the LA Bus Riders Union) alike. Transportation is a lifeline to opportunity, and in an urban environment where low-income people and people of color are more likely to rely on public transit for all basic needs, public transit is not only a Civil Right, it is a basic human right, without which people cannot live with dignity and respect. However, not all transportation or even public transit advocacy is \"justice-based\", even when coming from an \"equity\" perspective. OPAL's position is that addressing disparate impacts is \"equity\" work, though not necessarily environmental justice work. Environmental justice (and all justice work, broadly), requires the direct organizing and empowerment of those most impacted to be the leaders of the work. OPAL's transit justice work, by and through our Bus Riders Unite leadership and members, does exactly this, and sits at the intersection of environmental justice and Civil Rights.",

The issues we address are systemic, pervasive prejudices that continue to negatively impact our people in education, employment, and housing. Many of the civil rights challenges facing First Nation People are not covered by any existing culturally relevant legal jurisdictions or problem-solving venues. Because our community faces some of the most dire socioeconomic indicators and discrimination, we provide access to information on our rights and the laws against discrimination free of charge. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we have been working with Seattle School Superintendent to resolve community complaints of education inequities and discrimination against Native students. Three weeks ago the Superintendent announced the closer of Seattle Indian Heritage High School, and the relocation of our Native children to Northgate Mall for school year 2013-2014, and the termination of the Indian Education Program Manager. With the recent effort of forming a Native Coalition, our organization along with this newly forming coalition we got the Superintendent to reconsider transferring our children to the Mall to be educated, and changing the hiring process for an Indian Education Manager. The Superintendent is working with the Coalition, and will be meeting with the Native community on May 23rd to gather input on locating class space for Indian Heritage; and to draft a new hiring process to include Native Community Leaders to be involved in hiring the Indian Education Manager.

Per capita, our community have the harshest negative statistics of any ethnic group in the United States. We have the highest drop out rates but represent the least in student body. We have the lowest rate for college attainment, highest in teen pregnancy, unemployment, alcoholism, drug abuse, and domestic violence. Our community lacks access to quality mental/health care, and have the highest rate of homelessness, yet we make up only 3% of the total population in the nation. \r\n\r\nHistorical Trauma is a huge factor in this disproportionate scenario. Our ancestors were removed from their families, beaten for speaking their traditional language, forced to give up their cultural ways, and even killed. This history has left a deep scar in our hearts that still is, to this generation a heavy burden to bear. \r\n\r\nBefore the reality of these devastating statics can be transformed, the process of education must be expanded and incorporated into Indian country in a traditional way to ensure we reach the most vulnerable members of our community. WICRC has engaged in a community-wide effort to build an Urban Indian Coalition by soliciting Native Organizations, Community Leaders and interested community members at large to pull our resources together to form a powerful advocacy and service driven American Indian Coalition to support our most vulnerable community members, and exercise our right to self-determination. \r\n\r\nTo gain an effective outcome that will aid our people in attaining employment, higher education, quality mental/health care services, the Coalition will address current and future urgent situations that arise in our community through our collective expertise, and resources. The Coalition will work cohesively to conduct a comprehensive community-wide assessment to develop a co-op of intervention services in the community. We believe the coalition will bring about a more effective and efficient delivery of programs and eliminate any unnecessary duplication of effort by informing community organizations of duplicate services; funding sources; and being a unified voice for our people when violations occur. We will empower the community as a whole to take control of its future where our children will be prepared to compete similarly with non-native's in attaining quality higher education to be better prepared in competing for jobs in the evolving competitive work environment. Equitable secondary education, leads to attainment for higher education, that leads to better jobs, that leads to better housing and affordable and better health care, and in the end as a result of our collective efforts; will realize self-determination.\r\n",

We also collaborate with one an other when the Native community needs support to address inequities in schools across the state. We work with Native community's across the state to address school officials in a unified and organized way to get districts to change oppressive policies and practices. We help facilitate community discussion; and meetings between parents and school officials and work with both groups as they search for equitable solutions. \r\n\r\nOur collaborations typically don't cross constituency lines; however they do cross issues and we have always invited to the table other leaders from the various communities of color to stand in solidarity on similar issues that affect our community's equally. We have relationships with; NAACP; EL Centro de la Raza; Migrant Groups in E WA; Asian/Pacific Islander Groups; LGBTQ and Two Spirit Community; and with the Disabilities Community. \r\n ", 
    "narrative6": "Implicit bias and cognitive dissonance cause people to make serious and critical errors in judgment while feeling certain about the conclusions they reach. These decisions often influence, impact and deny people of color equitable access to quality health-care,  education, fair housing, employment opportunity as well as equal justice within the criminal justice system. WICRC works to resolve bias practices; and policies within institutions by addressing discrimination complaints in a professional manner. We assist individuals; or groups who feel their rights have been violated and educate them on the laws, and the process of redress. We also work collaboratively with the institutions and businesses who have been reported as being discriminating to help resolve the complaint; often times we are asked to assist them in providing civil rights and culturally competent training; help identify policies that violate local, state and federal civil rights laws; assist them in investigating the complaint and aid in the redress process. \r\n\r\nLast year, we helped resolve a very complicated case that involved a Native Elder and her employer, the U.S. Department of Interior. Due to our assistance in her case, our client prevailed and resolved her complaint by receiving back pay that was due to her being denied a salary increase for almost 8 years. Our client received back pay; early retirement with out penalty; personal damage compensation of $75,000.00. Our organization went on to work with the US DOI to assist them in providing their management staff with comprehensive training. They also changed their policies; and practices for giving salary increases to their employees. \r\n\r\nWICRC is a member organization that is involved with the Washington State Human Rights Commission as they develop rules for Sexual Orientation. Currently, the state agency is in the process of writing rules for the Washington State Laws Against Discrimination; and specifically rules based on Sexual Orientation. WICRC is involved on drafting the new rules for the State of Washington. We have also reached out to the Two Spirit Community to bring them to the table and be involved in this historic process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The UmojaFest PEACE Center addresses the issues of educational, cultural and economic under-development and the resulting  negative social environment in our community. \r\n\r\nThe root causes of economic inequity for African Americans are a product of their experience in America. Over the past 500 years, since Africans were brought to America as slaves, they and their descendants have been victims of systemic political, social, and economic marginalization that has led to the current economic inequities today. Slavery, Jim Crow Segregation, institutionalized racism, redlining, poor schools, and disproportionate incarceration have maintained an unequal playing field when it comes to economic attainment and advancement. Additionally the lack of understanding in capital management, wealth development, financial literacy, and community economic development lead to behaviors and lifestyle choices that further perpetuate cycles of economic inequity. \r\n\r\nc) Our work builds collective power through education, mobilizing, building and strengthening community.  We work to leverage culturally relevant programming, relationships and social capital to assist youth and young adults in developing a critical analysis and comprehension related to the current economic realities of the world we live in. We support their personal development with tools that build personal efficacy, self agency and community consciousness. We also organize and train them to advocate for systemic changes to reduce the inequities they face.\r\n\r\nMeeting youth where they are and building authentic relationships, culturally-informed identities and social competency is at the core of our model. UPC\u2019s educational programs provide positive, experiential learning to counter the negative culture that surrounds African-Americans and other urban youth. These programs help transform youth from passive consumers and spectators to active producers and participants.  The Center engages and trains youth, young adults and community members to be advocates for themselves and community through outreach, training, meeting with elected officials and other stakeholders as well as attending and participating in public forums and hearings. We also provide youth access to equipment and resources necessary to grow and learn in positive ways. Additionally our network represents over 100 organizations with whom we work with in various capacities. \r\n\r\nd) The work of the UPC and the the Africatown Community Development Initiative will address the underlying root causes and power dynamics by first increasing peoples understanding of them and how it can be changed. These are very big macro societal issues that will not be changed by any one group of people however our work will provide a model of how people can change their behavior individually and collectively thus changing the way they are related to and effected by forces and institutions. Ultimately, we see this work as key bringing fundamental shifts in the attitude, values and culture of the community.",

The African-American community has long been faced with oppression in this country, so educating our youth on our own history is key in helping them understand the structural oppression that is against them in this society. With structural oppression comes intersectionality. With intersectionality you see that no issue stands alone, therefore no issue can be fought alone. It is the fighting of all injustices - together - that we are able to achieve justice. This is where we see the mergence of different justice efforts. \r\n",

Our human rights work addresses food sovereignty, workplace rights, and women\u2019s rights; all under a broad human rights perspective focusing on leadership development from immigrant, farmworker, and marginalized Latino families.  C2C is led by women of color who have lived the reality that U.S. history reveals; that people of color, women, and poor and low income communities have been excluded from equitable access to nutritious food, fair wages, and civic participation. Acting on their knowledge and experience, C2C is committed to systemic change that is multi-faceted and complex enough to address the depth of oppression and abuse our community faces.  C2C is the only people of color led organization in Whatcom and Skagit County.  In developing projects with our emerging leaders, we have consistently come up against barriers of structural and institutional racism, deep-seated sexism and heteropatriarchy, homophobia, and structural poverty that we are actively working to dismantle.\r\nIn March of 2012 C2C launched the Campaign to End Racial Profiling in Whatcom County, to take on the work of publicly addressing race and oppression in the Latin@ farmworker community.  On May 5th 2013, we held the first ever Farm Worker March for Dignity, a historic 17-mile march from the rural area of Whatcom County into downtown Bellingham.  By the end of the march, we were a group of over 300 community members, half of whom are farmworkers from Whatcom County.  The March for Dignity represents the growing grassroots power that is being built with the farmworker community and being led by farmworker women, supported by local, state, regional, and national allies.  Our strengths are most visible in our leadership development and empowerment of farmworker women and youth.  This work is done through Cocinas Sanas (Healthy Kitchens) and Raices Culturales Youth Program.  In the last 6 months, Raices Culturales youth participation in Bellingham grew to 25 young people who regularly participate in weekly youth programs, and another 12 young women and men who actively seek out our Healthy Kitchens and Support Group.  At each program, we emphasize the power-building effects of community organizing to end all forms of oppression.  And we are continuing with our commitment to incorporate radical and creative play in our youth and children programming to break through rigid gender binary norms and patriarchy.\r\nWe create culturally appropriate community spaces that nurture dissenting activities and opinions against heteronormative patriarchy.  Our explicit grounding in eco-feminism is a firm base from which we approach our work to end oppression of, and within, the farmworker communities in Washington. At this time, C2C is a rare alternative place to hear and practice dissenting action against entrenched racism, sexism, and homophobia in rural Washington.  \r\n",

In the last 12 months, it is becoming increasingly clear that local leaders transforming the Whatcom County food systems, such as the Whatcom Food Network, are recognizing Latino farmworkers as integral to this transformation.  In partnership with grassroots leaders, C2C has built a momentum that now needs the support of a Projects Manager in order to sustain this momentum.\r\n\r\nC2C Executive Director Rosalinda Guillen has been a member of the Advisory Committee for the National Agricultural Justice Project since 1999 and has worked to develop domestic fair trade standards for farm workers in U.S. based family and medium sized farms. The standards are now complete and have been piloted in several states including Oregon and C2C is a recognized worker organization certified to conduct workplace audits and mediate conflicts between farmers and workers. This third party community based role is key to ensuring justice in the fields for farm workers in a domestic fair trade workplace that has implemented the standards and is using the AJP Fair Trade label in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nEach Project has built-in accountability measures through the Americorps Volunteers Program, the Campaign to End Racial Profiling Program, and the Raices Culturales Summer Institute for Youth Leadership Program.  C2C will measure the success of each program through these accountability measures specific to each program.  Additionally, C2C\u2019s continued leadership within regional and national structures such as the US Food Sovereignty Alliance, the Domestic Fair Trade Association, the Agricultural Justice Project will demonstrate how we have met our internal goals for Food Sovereignty and grassroots Movement Building.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Our work includes a circular programmatic leadership development approach that ultimately leads back from oppression to the creation of socially just solutions that can be sustained by the affected communities. One of these solutions that we strongly believe is the creation of a Solidarity Economy with the pillars of cooperative development and collaborative and participative democracy.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 C2C became a member of the Western States Center\u2019 Strong Families Northwest Cohort and will be a member of the Uniting Communities Cohort focusing on working with LGBTQ-identified people in the Latino farmworker communities in Whatcom County. This innovative partnership has provided training, collaboration opportunities and campaign strategy development to advance gender and reproductive justice in our region. This cohort models the focused ways that different sectors and movements can build shared analysis and action, particularly on the range of ways our families are being threatened and attacked. In many ways, this partnership has highlighted the need for Community to Community to go through an internal assessment and dialogue about how to deepen our commitment to gender justice and ending homophobia throughout all of our work. \r\n\r\nSince 1999, C2C Executive Director Rosalinda Guillen through the Agricultural Justice Project  has worked to develop domestic fair trade standards for farm workers in U.S. based family and medium sized farms. C2C has also been an organizing member and founding member of the National Domestic Fair Trade Association (DFTA), since its inception in 2004 and have won an elected place on the National Executive Board of the DFTA and C2C farm worker members are active participants on the farm worker caucus of the DFTA. Most recently C2C hosted a National Convocation for farm workers in Bellingham WA to introduce local Whatcom and Skagit farm workers and family farmers to Domestic Fair Trade. ", 
    "narrative6": "C2C focuses on human rights work in Whatcom County.  Our human rights work addresses food sovereignty, workplace rights, and women\u2019s rights; all under a broad human rights perspective focusing on leadership development from immigrant, farmworker, and marginalized Latino families.  C2C is led by women of color who have lived the reality that U.S. history reveals; that people of color, women, and poor and low income communities have been excluded from equitable access to nutritious food, fair wages, and civic participation. Acting on their knowledge and experience, C2C is committed to systemic change that is multi-faceted and complex enough to address the depth of oppression and abuse our community faces.  C2C is the only people of color led organization in Whatcom and Skagit County.  In developing projects with our emerging leaders, we have consistently come up against barriers of structural and institutional racism, deep-seated sexism and heteropatriarchy, homophobia, and structural poverty that we are actively working to dismantle.\r\nIn March of 2012 C2C launched the Campaign to End Racial Profiling in Whatcom County, to take on the work of publicly addressing race and oppression in the Latin@ farmworker community.  On May 5th 2013, we held the first ever Farm Worker March for Dignity, a historic 17-mile march from the rural area of Whatcom County into downtown Bellingham.  By the end of the march, we were a group of over 300 community members, half of whom are farmworkers from Whatcom County.  The March for Dignity represents the growing grassroots power that is being built with the farmworker community and being led by farmworker women, supported by local, state, regional, and national allies.  Our strengths are most visible in our leadership development and empowerment of farmworker women and youth.  This work is done through Cocinas Sanas (Healthy Kitchens) and Raices Culturales Youth Program.  In the last 6 months, Raices Culturales youth participation in Bellingham grew to 25 young people who regularly participate in weekly youth programs, and another 12 young women and men who actively seek out our Healthy Kitchens and Support Group.  At each program, we emphasize the power-building effects of community organizing to end all forms of oppression.  And we are continuing with our commitment to incorporate radical and creative play in our youth and children programming to break through rigid gender binary norms and patriarchy.\r\nWe create culturally appropriate community spaces that nurture dissenting activities and opinions against heteronormative patriarchy.  Our explicit grounding in eco-feminism is a firm base from which we approach our work to end oppression of, and within, the farmworker communities in Washington. At this time, C2C is a rare alternative place to hear and practice dissenting action against entrenched racism, sexism, and homophobia in rural Washington.  \r\n",

    "narrative1": "The Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance (MIJA) was formed in 2012 as a statewide non-profit organization working for immigrant rights. MIJA's mission is to educate the public about our migrant communities and provide services to empower these communities. Although a new organization, MIJA grew out of immigrant justice work previously led by the Gallatin Valley Human Rights Task Force (GVHRTF) and its community advisory board \"Salud y Comunidad: Latinos en Montana\" made up of Mexican migrant community members and bilingual community organizers.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, the GVHRTF and Salud y Comunidad centered its work on immigrant justice. Using a community-engagement model, we worked to deliver \"Know your Rights\" legal clinics, health clinics, and educational programming in Southwest Montana. To do this work, we partnered with immigration attorneys (including Shahid Haque-Hausrath), community health clinics, Catholic churches, and faculty and students across Montana State University to build awareness and bridges across communities.  However, over time, it became clear we needed a dedicated immigrant rights organization.\r\n\r\nWith funding from SJF, the GVHRTF, Salud y Comunidad, and immigration attorney Shahid Haque-Hausrath formed MIJA. Structurally, MIJA has a Board of Directors (BOD; including former GVHRTF board members, Salud y Comunidad members, and other individuals from around the state who are dedicated to immigrant justice). Those Salud y Comunidad members who do not wish to join the MIJA BOD continue to serve in an advisory capacity and support organizing efforts. This past February, MIJA and Salud y Comunidad attended a weekend retreat led by Bonnie Satchetello-Sawyer of HOPA Mountain to formalize our structure, mission and vision.  \r\n\r\nSince its incorporation, MIJA has continued to provide legal and health clinics, co-organized a statewide rally for Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR), and has led the legal fight against LR-121, a referendum to deny certain state services to \u201cillegal aliens\u201d.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Although Montana has a small immigrant population, this population is under attack and the national anti-immigrant discourse (fueled by corporate greed, a weakened economy, racism, and class warfare) is seeking to marginalize and criminalize immigrants--and especially those coming from the global south to escape the ill-effects of policies like NAFTA. The Montana Legislature continues to develop (and pass) numerous anti-immigrant laws that preclude immigrants from accessing services and legal protections in the workplace. Montanans overwhelmingly passed LR121 which denies undocumented immigrants access to myriad state services (including access to higher education, victim services). And while anti-immigration efforts affect all of us by bolstering a hostile, ill-informed, anti-immigrant community, the most vulnerable include migrants from Mexico in search of a better life. \r\n\r\nResearch conducted locally by MIJA Vice President Bethany Letiecq (Associate Professor, Family and Community Health, MSU) suggests members of the Mexican migrant community have been negatively impacted by this context, suffering from high levels of depression, worry, and fear and other poor physical health outcomes. Many immigrants here live on the social and economic margins, and many choose not to organize against immigrant injustice because of fears of being \"out\" in the community and targeted for deportation. Montana is not a very welcoming or safe place for Mexican migrants, especially those without papers, and our work seeks to address these problems and build collective power using a multi-layered approach.\r\n\r\nFor the past 5 years, GVHRTF and Salud y Comunidad and now MIJA have been working in concert to organize for immigrant justice. It has proven to be a slow going but sustained effort increasingly led by new immigrants. Focusing at the individual-level, we have worked to address the basic needs, health care needs, and legal needs of Mexican migrants. Using social media and word of mouth organizing, we offer Know Your Rights legal and health clinics (with partner health organizations) as well as clinics with the Mexican Consulate. These efforts seek to facilitate resource acquisition and address basic security and safety needs of community members. These efforts also provide for social engagement, build solidarity, counter feelings of isolation, and identify those emerging leaders who choose to courageously step into leadership roles either through Salud y Comunidad or MIJA engagement.\r\n\r\nStatewide, our efforts build collective power by growing a coalition of organizations for immigrant justice.  At this level, we work with our partners to resource-share to push pro-immigration messaging and educate communities and legislators about immigration, discrimination, family separation, and the criminalization of migrants. We lobby collectively against anti-immigrant laws and for CIR. And MIJA has led the fight against LR121. These combined efforts seek to counter anti-immigration efforts and empower Mexican migrant community members to actualize justice.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "narrative4": "Workplan:\r\n\r\n1. Community Clinics: Led by our community organizers, we will offer at least four clinics to provide free legal and health-related services and connection to the Mexican Consulate. At clinics, Salud y Comunidad members will sell traditional Mexican food and provide child care. We house these clinics in safe spaces now well-known to the migrant community.\r\n\r\n2. Education and Outreach: To educate community members and service providers, we will hold educational forums at local churches and libraries (led by MIJA/Salud members) and host at least one service provider training in partnership with local health and public services organization allies.\r\n\r\n3. LR121 Lawsuit: MIJA's Shahid Haque-Hausrath (with attorney Brian Morris) are working pro bono to challenge and enjoin LR121. MIJA has already succeeded in obtaining a partial preliminary injunction stopping portions of the law from going into effect.  See http://www.mija.org/immigration-facts/lawsuit-against-lr-121/ . As this lawsuit continues, we seek funds to pay for certain court expenses, travel and translators for critical witnesses, and to pay for costs associated with depositions.\r\n\r\n4. Organizational Growth: Finally, our workplan seeks to continue to grow MIJA and our local and statewide coalitions. Through mailings, fundraisers, and outreach efforts, we hope to grow MIJA's membership base. Our coalition building efforts are necessary as we need all hands on deck to build a progressive, pro-immigration movement in Montana.\r\n\r\nWe will disseminate our workplan and provide updates to the community documenting what we have achieved (using Facebook and MIJA website). We will assess our work by holding monthly meetings with Salud y Comunidad who will continuously check with their migrant networks seeking feedback on our efforts. This reporting will ensure accountability. We will also periodically assess board membership and recruit immigrant leaders to serve--our numbers will reflect our success at sustaining MIJA and Salud Y Comunidad and community empowerment.", 
    "narrative5": "Two central statewide partnerships with MIJA and Salud y Comunidad are the Montana Human Rights Network (MHRN) and Montana Women Vote (MWV). Both MHRN and MWV have provided technical support, shared membership lists, and provided resources to substantially support the growth and educational outreach efforts of MIJA/Salud. For example, our partners have helped to fund mailings on CIR and LR121 and have conducted phone banks with us to educate voters about LR121. Such collaborations allow us to expand our reach and help us to target different audiences as we work to educate our constituencies about immigrant justice.\r\n\r\nMIJA and Salud y Comunidad bring to our collaborations the largest network of immigrants in the state. We use Facebook and the MIJA website to inform our membership of upcoming events, educate them about immigrant issues, and alert them to legal and policy updates (e.g., CIR, LR121). Our \"closed group\" Salud y Comunidad/MIJA Facebook page currently includes 208 members and the content is delivered mostly in Spanish (or easily translated using FB tools). Because Montana's foreign-born population comprises 2% of the population, migrants are often hidden and hard to reach. Our partners do not have the resources to develop deep networks within the immigrant population. But they have significant expertise and statewide reach. Our collaborations and resource sharing yield significant \u201cbang for the buck\u201d and, importantly, support critical analysis work to ensure we are not working to empower one group while marginalizing or \u201cothering\u201d another group.\r\n \r\nBy collaborating with MHRN and MWV (among many other organizations, such as churches, community health clinics, student organizations), we strategically leverage our resources in a state that is the 4th largest in area with just over 1 million people. Our collaborations unify us as we rely on each other to build a democratic, community-based, participatory progressive movement.   \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Our work clearly focuses on racial justice as anti-immigrant efforts are discriminatory and racist at their roots. Immigrant justice will yield racial justice (and vice versa). Our work draws upon two frameworks--a cultural ecological framework and a racial justice framework. From an ecological perspective, we recognize the connections between individuals, families, communities, and state and federal governments. Efforts to promote immigrant and racial justice must be multi-layered as we seek to empower individuals by working to ensure their basic needs are met while also changing opportunity structures, laws and social policies at all levels of society. And it is a collective effort where those who are most vulnerable are empowered to lead and those most privileged are called upon to use their power and social location to address inequalities, discriminatory practices, and policies that for too long have been used to oppress people of color. \r\n\r\nIn addition, a racial Justice framework is central to the values and work of MIJA (and our coalition partners including MHRN and MWV) and a racial justice lens will be used as strategies, tactics, and decisions are being made throughout our effort.  To constructively work on immigrant justice there must be a racial justice framework.  Many immigrant communities are communities of color and for the last two decades, the overarching public narrative around immigration has been framed around race (mainly by anti-immigrant opponents).  In our efforts, a racial justice framework means ensuring that our collaboration is assessing disproportionate impact and outcomes for immigrant communities of color who are disproportionately poor.  \r\n\r\nOne significant strength of this proposal is our commitment to ensure immigrant leadership on MIJA and Salud y Comunidad boards and to work in partnership with Montana\u2019s immigrant communities on all phases of the work. Through community-based, participatory, and democratic processes, we will work in concert to build on our collective strengths while centering those most affected by anti-immigration efforts. We collectively believe that the most vulnerable among us must be those who lead the discourse on racial justice and guide our efforts to actualize justice.  Thus, we are committed to redistributing power where we can and empowering members of the immigrant community to lead. We are well-situated to carry out this work, given the last six years of organizing within the immigrant communities (especially in the Gallatin Valley) and recent organizational work between MIJA (comprised of 5 immigrant community members of color) and Salud y Comunidad (which is made up of a majority of Mexican migrant community members). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "For years now, we have witnessed the criminalization of the immigrant community, especially immigrants of color and immigrants who have been systematically and economically marginalized. We continue to read in our local and national media outlets and hear people use the term \"illegal immigrant\" when referring to people who are not currently authorized to be in the US. Immigrants have been systematically dehumanized and criminalized in the US.  \r\n\r\nIn Montana, our Mexican migrant community partners have shared countless stories about  illegal workplace practices, racial profiling, racial and workplace discrimination, resultant economic strife, health care crises, fears of deportation, family separation due to deportation, and overt hostility and bad acts committed against immigrants of color. Because of their social location, many migrants have few opportunities for redress. We have witnessed the erosion of due process and immigrant justice. For example, we have heard stories where Montana's law enforcement agents work in partnership with ICE on the highways to target immigrants of color, make what we would consider to be questionable stops, where local law enforcement officers then ask questions about status, and then turn immigrants over to ICE on the spot if drivers and/or passengers cannot document their status. And most recently, under sequestration we are seeing emergent hits to immigrant justice. Montana's deportation cases are no longer heard in Montana--the proceedings are now televised and heard at a distance in Texas. As immigrants are marginalized in our local, state, and federal systems, they are systematically dehumanized and criminalized. \r\n\r\nOur efforts seek to support and empower Montana's immigrant communities and especially the Mexican migrant communities  here by educating community members about their rights, providing free legal and health services, and providing safe and supportive opportunities to congregate, be social, and share resources.  This work is needed perhaps now more than ever. ",

Opening doors works to mitigate the effects of incarceration and institutionalization on the family that is left behind, and the individual upon their release.  Opening doors has consistently maintained a 92% success rate in reintegrating returning individuals into the community.  Many of our returnees have completed their educational goals up to the master\u2019s degree level. \r\nOpening Doors planned, formed  and began grassroots organizing efforts to create the Montana Coalition for Safety and Justice with  the goal of creating a statewide sustainable organization whose members are organizations working with those most affected by the system.  The Coalition is founded on the vision that many strings can fashion a strong rope and with that rope, great weights can be lifted.  The Montana Coalition for Safety and Justice began to operate in the legislative area in 2011 and has been successful in providing valuable testimony and support for those individuals who came forward to provide information to legislators.  These efforts have resulted in stopping efforts to place barriers to homeownership, housing, employment, access to financial institutions, and social services to families who have a member involved in the criminal justice system.\r\nMontana Coalition for Safety and Justice through its members advocated for legislation that would bring equality of access and remove barriers to a quality life for our constituents.\r\n\r\nOur advocacy efforts have resulted in a legislative study of Parole and Probation, the Coalition hopes to assist constituents in travel and community organization to put a spotlight on policies that re-incarcerate individuals for providing for their families and barring them from meaningful employment and traps children in a system without checks and balances.",

    "narrative3": "The Montana Coalition for Safety and Justice Project addresses the injustice and inequity that pollutes Montana correctional system.  The policies and regulations of the system create barriers and promote failure.  Each year, over 2000 children enter the juvenile justice system in Montana for the first time.  This equates to approximately 20% of the children born each year in Montana.  Many of these children will continue to be in the system as adults.  Some of the recent outcomes of our system can only leave when shaking their head 10-year-olds arrested and given $500,000 bail for missing\u2019s and being disrespectful in school,  15-year-olds being sent to the adult prison and confined to solitary incarceration because it is too dangerous for them to be in the general population due to their age. \r\nOver 60% of the Montana prison population has been re- incarcerated for non-criminal violations of probation or parole.  The Montana parole and probation regulations are, unconstitutional and impossible to follow in many instances.  In Montana, a parolee or probationer can be re-incarcerated because they pay for utilities, which is considered a debt and having debt may be a reason for revocation of a parole or probation.  But failure to provide such necessities for your family is a violation of state law, which would result in re-incarceration. As crazy as it sounds, there are people in prison for going to the hospital, getting married, purchasing a puppy for their children, or simply being Native American.\r\nThe Coalition works to build collective power by organizing its constituency throughout the state in educating and supporting local initiative proposals to end discrimination in housing, education, employment, credit, voter rights and access to financial services solely based on criminal history.  On the state level we are the voice of our community.  In the last year, several of our supporting members who testified before the legislature or physically threatened by members of the parole board and corrections department personnel in an effort to intimidate and bar them from bringing their information to legislative committees.  As a Coalition we provide that voice as a group and protect  those who would be singled out for retribution for bringing their story to light.\r\n\r\nBy organizing it is not the individual that speaks but the organization, as an organization the current power structure can be effectively modified to effect housing, education and employment barriers. The strategy of education combined with organization provides information and incentive to change policies and bias that create long term negative effects on the families and children of ex-prisoners. The Coalition serves as a shield against systemic blatant retribution and intimidation perpetrated by government officials. \r\n",

This will entail gathering data and finishing our study of parole and probation outcomes spanning 10 years.  Final editing and presentation to the committees is scheduled for September 30, 2013.\r\nThe Coalition Project will attend provide comments to appropriate legislative committees and work with those committees to eliminate and reduce barriers to reentry and create a just and equitable system that will empower families and individuals to achieve economic security.  Legislative work is an ongoing task throughout the next year, and such work is done on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.  Our goal in the legislative task force is to have a minimum of three committee bills that remove barriers to reentry.\r\nAt a time appropriate between April and June 2014, it is our goal an intention to organize a day of action at the capital to bring attention to the injustice and the runaway costs of the correctional system.  We propose to highlight that the current policies and system lesson community safety, increases taxpayer cost, without providing any benefit.  Our goal is to have this day attended by a minimum of 100 supporters, constituents and their families.\r\nDuring this timeframe from June to September 2014, work on voter registration and education to encourage our constituency to become an active part of the democratic process.  We will be working during this time, to remove any barriers that we have previously encountered or that we may encounter in registration and encouragement of constituents voters rights.  Our goal in voter rights is to register a minimum of 800 constituent voters. \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Opening Doors is a Part of the Montana Coalition Project and works with other organizations that have similar missions and constituencies to affect positive change.  These partnerships were demonstrated  by coordination of support and advocacy for and against various legislative positions that directly affected our mutual communities.\r\nThe Coalition works to create greater impact by collaborating and focusing the efforts of many organizations to address the issues faced by our mutual members.  Opening Doors works to build a foundation of mutual trust, respect between many organizations  that share similar ideals.  Opening Doors helped re-create the Reentry Task Force for Cascade County to address reentry issues locally and bring local resources to bear.  Opening doors is also worked hard to create long-lasting partnerships with community organizations that provide services and material support to individuals that fit our mutual demographics.  Through these partnerships we've increased the number of satellite food banks and rotation of material goods to organizations that can effectively distribute the materials to those in need.\r\nBecause opening doors has worked in many areas such as food distribution, housing issues, and employment issues, and economic empowerment issues that are not limited to those we serve, opening doors can call on other organizations only worked with to show a unified front for change.\r\nAn example of such a successful collaboration can be found in the coordinated advocacy activities to remove barriers to employment, post incarceration.  This collaboration consisted of the Montana Chamber Of Commerce, Landlords Association National Association for the Mentally Ill and Opening Doors.  Opening doors through the Montana coalition worked with voter registration groups to ensure and encourage our constituency to participate in the election process.  Although our success was not 100% in preventing the denial of the right to vote, we increased constituency turnout and participation.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Our work in correctional system reform includes working on racial justice.  Native Americans are greatly overrepresented in the correctional system.  This overrepresentation is clearly seen at the Montana State women\u2019s prison, where, over 72% of that prisons population is Native American.  By reforming the corrections system and in turn reforming the justice system, opening doors through the Montana coalition project works to organize and educate our elected representatives in the community at large in the disparity of sentencing, parole grants, re-incarceration\u2019s, and law enforcement that statistically shows an unjustifiable focus on individuals based on their racial characteristics.  This is symptomatic of an underlying bias toward individuals of color.\r\nThis unstated bias can also be found in employment data that shows Native Americans and others of color are significantly overrepresented in unemployment and underemployment data.  Because of the disproportionate effect on minorities in employment and incarceration is created and economic injustice that is further compounded by an imbalance in parole and probation restrictions that cannot be justified by the underlying criminal activity.  Minority offenders and their families are often subjected to additional restrictions not imposed on white offenders.\r\nOur efforts to reform the criminal justice system and our inclusion at all levels of our leadership,  those most affected by these biases we give an example through personal action that such biases are unfounded and cannot be justified.  The Coalition has worked hard to volunteer efforts to compile over 10 years of data from parole, probation and criminal Justice statistics that confirm such bias exists.  Opening doors through the Coalition and its partners is working to remove that bias from the system.  By requiring additional Native American and other minority members be appointed to the board of pardons and parole, employed as probation, parole officers, and removing the imposition of conditions of parole that are not connected to the crime.\r\n",

This work empowers a constituency and educates the community at large, so that positive change will happen.\r\nWhen the criminal justice system places barriers and restrictions that resulted in an inability to successfully reenter by finding meaningful employment, housing, and food, there is no justice.  The current Montana correctional system has criminalized normal behavior, hopes and aspirations.  \r\nThe mentally ill fill the prison and are denied medical and mental health treatment on a routine basis and are then denied parole or probation based on actions that are attributable to their mental health.  There is no justice.\r\nNative Americans overwhelmingly disproportionally represented in the prison system and is a data shows or more likely to be revoked if and parole or probation due to their race.  This bias is clearly shown and the overrepresentation of Native American women in the prison system.\r\nThe documented mistreatment of prisoners based on gender identification issues by correctional personnel and the documented rape of prisoners under their care is unconscionable.  Even when these injustices are brought to light and the prisoner complains the officer is rarely charged in the prisoner is placed in solitary confinement.  In short, the prisoner/victim is punished to a greater degree than a perpetrator.\r\nThe work of the Montana coalition addresses each and every one of these issues and the coalition seeks to end these practices, policies, and eradicate the biases that have grown like a mold in the corrections system.  \r\n",

    "narrative3": "DTL, Huerto de la Familia and the IN are aware of many of the underlying causes of social injustice that translate into a cycle of poverty and alienation for  many people of color and immigrant families. The interconnected problems, needs, and issues that our work addresses include, but are not necessarily limited to: immigration status, racism, classism, poverty, hunger, literacy, language proficiency, and the holistic, thoughtful integration of immigrant communities into the larger multi-cultural society. The root causes of these issues are structural, interconnected, and all ultimately products of the United States' failed immigration systems and policies. \r\n\r\nImmigrants, many of Hispanic origins, face an array of barriers for accessing resources in the American society that stem from a lack of language skills, lack of formal education, lack of literacy, extremely negative social stereotypes, lack of training for accessing better-paid jobs, and an absence of a strong social support system or isolation. \r\n\r\nOur organizations address these issues by offering an array of tools for becoming more self sufficient and aware of the value that each individual can bring to the community. DTL helps students develop language skills and computer skills that will allow them to further their education, receive work training and interact with the society at large. Huerto de la Familia provides ways for families to be more economically self-sufficient as they grow their own food and receive education on how to develop a small business. The Integration Network provides opportunities for American born and immigrant communities to come together to interact and hopefully through those interactions, feel less threatened by cultural and racial differences as both parties recognize the human being behind the cultural construct. \r\n\r\nThese 3 organizations work together to create support systems and bring information to immigrant families to be more aware of their rights no matter what their documentation status may be.  \r\n\r\nAs the immigrant individuals that participate in our programs build collective power with one another, they begin to develop the capacity to take more direct control over their own lives, become leaders in their local communities in whatever capacity that may be, improve their physical and mental health, and strengthen their relationships with their children and other family members. While our work may not necessarily change the root causes of the problems that we attempt to alleviate, we do feel that our work helps to make these problems less powerful and less controlling over the lives of the immigrant families that we work with.\r\n\r\nSince the staff of Downtown Languages, Huerto de la Familia and the organizations involved with IN have ongoing contact with immigrant communities and have gained their trust, we will be the first people that individuals approach regarding immigration reform.",

To hold four training sessions in the form of workshops for the immigrant community, one in English and three in Spanish, for people to understand the requirements, and the application procedures.\r\n\r\nKnowledge is power and the goal behind this project is to empower families through information that may help them make changes in their immigration status as well as to know their rights no matter what legal status they may have. \r\n\r\nWe will conduct pre and post assessment surveys in all of our sessions and workshops to determine how much information each individual was able to gather. We will pay special attention to those individuals that may have low literacy levels in order to provide additional support and follow-up either to refer them to appropriate organizations or to deliver the information in a different set up.

    "narrative5": "DTL works in partnerships with many networks and collaborations to advance social change. We are part of the Integration Network for Immigrants of Lane County, a network with representatives from the city, school districts, lawyers, and non-profits, whose mission is to create awareness of the importance of integrating immigrants in our community as well as creating events for interaction among immigrants and the rest of the community. We have held conversation sessions between immigrants and an array of agencies and institutions to open bridges of interaction and communication. We have done political lobbying to influence \r\npolitician\u00b4s decisions on immigration reform such as meetings with representative Peter DeFazio and we are organizing a conference on issues that affect immigrants in the areas of education, health, civic participation and food supply.\r\n\r\nDTL is part of a movement called Communities that Care, whose goal is to create better opportunities for children and adolescents. The goal of this group is to include people from many agencies and institutions to work together on creating policies that will influence the quality and significance of services that children and youth receive. The role of DTL in this group is to ensure that the needs of the immigrant population are considered when creating policies, programs and making decisions. \r\n\r\nDTL, Huerto and the IN have recently joined another group whose mission is to detect potential Latino leaders, especially those that could eventually be political leaders. The group will act as a support group that will collaborate to find financial and non-financial resources to develop the leadership skills of those individuals that will represent the Latino and immigrant community. \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "DTL is an organization that serves people of color and is led by both Anglos and people of color. As mentioned above, more than 50% of our staff is composed of first and second generation Hispanics from different countries: Colombia, Per\u00fa, Argentina and M\u00e9xico. We additionally have a teacher from Bulgaria. Our Board of Directors has 9 members of whom 4 are of Hispanic origin. This year, our goal is to include at least one person of Asian origin on our Board. \r\n\r\nMore than 50% of Huerto\u00b4s board and staff are Latino, one member is a Jamaican immigrant, and all of their program participants are Latino immigrants. \r\n\r\nThe Integration Network is composed of people from many different ethnic backgrounds, gender orientation and social background. We have first, second and third generation immigrants from Asia and Latin America, as well as Jewish members.  \r\n\r\nDTL, Huerto de la familia and the Integration Network believe that knowledge is power, and that being informed is a step towards claiming your own rights and paving a better life for yourself and your family. As immigrants become more knowledgeable, they pass this information to other people, creating a network from which more leadership can evolve. Our organizations are working together and creating situations and spaces for more community organizing to happen. \r\n\r\nThe immigrant community of Lane County is still young; it has grown 85 percent since 2000. Additionally, there is a large undocumented population in our area that faces many barriers in addition to their immigration status, including lack of formal education, and language skills. A study conducted by the Department of Education revealed that 44% of Hispanics possess skills below basic literacy levels and the 2010 U.S. census, revealed that more than one-fourth of Hispanic adults have less than a ninth-grade education and only 30% have completed high school. Our community is in the process of developing structures and foundations that will allow us to eventually be more integrated.\r\n\r\nOne of the main goals of our organizations is to provide tools for immigrants to integrate in our community by developing language skills and getting education that will allow them to access information about their rights in order to obtain better employment, and to know their rights in relation to the law and their immigration status.\r\n\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "In Lane County, Oregon the Latino immigrant population has grown 85 percent since 2000. Therefore the population is relatively new and comprises 8-15 percent of the total population. This range is large due to the nature of the census  which does not count all of the undocumented immigrants. As mentioned before there are many challenges facing this population. Many people are undocumented, the average educational level is 9th grade, and many have limited proficiency in English. Understanding how immigration reform affects someone individually is the first step in being able to develop personal power.  Once this information is understood, the individual will know what steps to take to become documented. They will be clearer about their rights under the law. Documented status allows an individual to have more power in the society- more  security, more freedom of movement, more access to education and other services, better paid employment, and more rights. Once a person achieves this, it is easier to become a leader and to have the power to influence further change.",

    "narrative1": "The Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance (MIJA) was formed in 2012 as a statewide non-profit organization working for immigrant rights. MIJA's mission is to educate the public about our migrant communities and provide services to empower these communities. Although a new organization, MIJA grew out of immigrant justice work previously led by the Gallatin Valley Human Rights Task Force (GVHRTF) and its community advisory board \"Salud y Comunidad: Latinos en Montana\" made up of Mexican migrant community members and bilingual community organizers.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, the GVHRTF and Salud y Comunidad centered its work on immigrant justice. Using a community-engagement model, we worked to deliver \"Know your Rights\" legal clinics, health clinics, and educational programming in Southwest Montana. To do this work, we partnered with immigration attorneys (including Shahid Haque-Hausrath), community health clinics, Catholic churches, and faculty and students across Montana State University to build awareness and bridges across communities.  However, over time, it became clear we needed a dedicated immigrant rights organization.\r\n\r\nWith funding from SJF, the GVHRTF, Salud y Comunidad, and immigration attorney Shahid Haque-Hausrath formed MIJA. Structurally, MIJA has a Board of Directors (BOD; including former GVHRTF board members, Salud y Comunidad members, and other individuals from around the state who are dedicated to immigrant justice). Those Salud y Comunidad members who do not wish to join the MIJA BOD continue to serve in an advisory capacity and support organizing efforts. This past February, MIJA and Salud y Comunidad attended a weekend retreat led by Bonnie Satchetello-Sawyer of HOPA Mountain to formalize our structure, mission and vision.  \r\n\r\nSince its incorporation, MIJA has continued to provide legal and health clinics, co-organized a statewide rally for Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR), and has led the legal fight against LR-121, a referendum to deny certain state services to \u201cillegal aliens\u201d.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "Although Montana has a small immigrant population, this population is under attack and the national anti-immigrant discourse (fueled by corporate greed, a weakened economy, racism, and class warfare) is seeking to marginalize and criminalize immigrants--and especially those coming from the global south to escape the ill-effects of policies like NAFTA. The Montana Legislature continues to develop (and pass) numerous anti-immigrant laws that preclude immigrants from accessing services and legal protections in the workplace. Montanans overwhelmingly passed LR121 which denies undocumented immigrants access to myriad state services (including access to higher education, victim services). And while anti-immigration efforts affect all of us by bolstering a hostile, ill-informed, anti-immigrant community, the most vulnerable include migrants from Mexico in search of a better life. \r\n\r\nResearch conducted locally by MIJA Vice President Bethany Letiecq (Associate Professor, Family and Community Health, MSU) suggests members of the Mexican migrant community have been negatively impacted by this context, suffering from high levels of depression, worry, and fear and other poor physical health outcomes. Many immigrants here live on the social and economic margins, and many choose not to organize against immigrant injustice because of fears of being \"out\" in the community and targeted for deportation. Montana is not a very welcoming or safe place for Mexican migrants, especially those without papers, and our work seeks to address these problems and build collective power using a multi-layered approach.\r\n\r\nFor the past 5 years, GVHRTF and Salud y Comunidad and now MIJA have been working in concert to organize for immigrant justice. It has proven to be a slow going but sustained effort increasingly led by new immigrants. Focusing at the individual-level, we have worked to address the basic needs, health care needs, and legal needs of Mexican migrants. Using social media and word of mouth organizing, we offer Know Your Rights legal and health clinics (with partner health organizations) as well as clinics with the Mexican Consulate. These efforts seek to facilitate resource acquisition and address basic security and safety needs of community members. These efforts also provide for social engagement, build solidarity, counter feelings of isolation, and identify those emerging leaders who choose to courageously step into leadership roles either through Salud y Comunidad or MIJA engagement.\r\n\r\nStatewide, our efforts build collective power by growing a coalition of organizations for immigrant justice.  At this level, we work with our partners to resource-share to push pro-immigration messaging and educate communities and legislators about immigration, discrimination, family separation, and the criminalization of migrants. We lobby collectively against anti-immigrant laws and for CIR. And MIJA has led the fight against LR121. These combined efforts seek to counter anti-immigration efforts and empower Mexican migrant community members to actualize justice.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "narrative4": "Workplan:\r\n\r\n1. Community Clinics: Led by our community organizers, we will offer at least four clinics to provide free legal and health-related services and connection to the Mexican Consulate. At clinics, Salud y Comunidad members will sell traditional Mexican food and provide child care. We house these clinics in safe spaces now well-known to the migrant community.\r\n\r\n2. Education and Outreach: To educate community members and service providers, we will hold educational forums at local churches and libraries (led by MIJA/Salud members) and host at least one service provider training in partnership with local health and public services organization allies.\r\n\r\n3. Organizing for CIR:  Work with partners in Montana to build membership around comprehensive immigration reform.  Although we have a Congressman who may not be moveable on CIR, we were successful in getting the right votes from our two Senators, who previously voted against immigration relief.  We can continue to mount pressure on Rep. Daines and use this as an opportunity to build membership around this issue.  \r\n\r\n4. Organizational Growth: Finally, our workplan seeks to continue to grow MIJA and our local and statewide coalitions. Through mailings, fundraisers, and outreach efforts, we hope to grow MIJA's membership base. Our coalition building efforts are necessary as we need all hands on deck to build a progressive, pro-immigration movement in Montana.\r\n\r\nWe will disseminate our workplan and provide updates to the community documenting what we have achieved (using Facebook and MIJA website). We will assess our work by holding monthly meetings with Salud y Comunidad who will continuously check with their migrant networks seeking feedback on our efforts. This reporting will ensure accountability. We will also periodically assess board membership and recruit immigrant leaders to serve--our numbers will reflect our success at sustaining MIJA and Salud Y Comunidad and community empowerment.", 
    "narrative5": "Two central statewide partnerships with MIJA and Salud y Comunidad are the Montana Human Rights Network (MHRN) and Montana Women Vote (MWV). Both MHRN and MWV have provided technical support, shared membership lists, and provided resources to substantially support the growth and educational outreach efforts of MIJA/Salud. For example, our partners have helped to fund mailings on CIR and LR121 and have conducted phone banks with us to educate voters about LR121. Such collaborations allow us to expand our reach and help us to target different audiences as we work to educate our constituencies about immigrant justice.\r\n\r\nMIJA and Salud y Comunidad bring to our collaborations the largest network of immigrants in the state. We use Facebook and the MIJA website to inform our membership of upcoming events, educate them about immigrant issues, and alert them to legal and policy updates (e.g., CIR, LR121). Our \"closed group\" Salud y Comunidad/MIJA Facebook page currently includes 208 members and the content is delivered mostly in Spanish (or easily translated using FB tools). Because Montana's foreign-born population comprises 2% of the population, migrants are often hidden and hard to reach. Our partners do not have the resources to develop deep networks within the immigrant population. But they have significant expertise and statewide reach. Our collaborations and resource sharing yield significant \u201cbang for the buck\u201d and, importantly, support critical analysis work to ensure we are not working to empower one group while marginalizing or \u201cothering\u201d another group.\r\n \r\nBy collaborating with MHRN and MWV (among many other organizations, such as churches, community health clinics, student organizations), we strategically leverage our resources in a state that is the 4th largest in area with just over 1 million people. Our collaborations unify us as we rely on each other to build a democratic, community-based, participatory progressive movement.   \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Our work clearly focuses on racial justice as anti-immigrant efforts are discriminatory and racist at their roots. Immigrant justice will yield racial justice (and vice versa). Our work draws upon two frameworks--a cultural ecological framework and a racial justice framework. From an ecological perspective, we recognize the connections between individuals, families, communities, and state and federal governments. Efforts to promote immigrant and racial justice must be multi-layered as we seek to empower individuals by working to ensure their basic needs are met while also changing opportunity structures, laws and social policies at all levels of society. And it is a collective effort where those who are most vulnerable are empowered to lead and those most privileged are called upon to use their power and social location to address inequalities, discriminatory practices, and policies that for too long have been used to oppress people of color. \r\n\r\nIn addition, a racial Justice framework is central to the values and work of MIJA (and our coalition partners including MHRN and MWV) and a racial justice lens will be used as strategies, tactics, and decisions are being made throughout our effort.  To constructively work on immigrant justice there must be a racial justice framework.  Many immigrant communities are communities of color and for the last two decades, the overarching public narrative around immigration has been framed around race (mainly by anti-immigrant opponents).  In our efforts, a racial justice framework means ensuring that our collaboration is assessing disproportionate impact and outcomes for immigrant communities of color who are disproportionately poor.  \r\n\r\nOne significant strength of this proposal is our commitment to ensure immigrant leadership on MIJA and Salud y Comunidad boards and to work in partnership with Montana\u2019s immigrant communities on all phases of the work. Through community-based, participatory, and democratic processes, we will work in concert to build on our collective strengths while centering those most affected by anti-immigration efforts. We collectively believe that the most vulnerable among us must be those who lead the discourse on racial justice and guide our efforts to actualize justice.  Thus, we are committed to redistributing power where we can and empowering members of the immigrant community to lead. We are well-situated to carry out this work, given the last six years of organizing within the immigrant communities (especially in the Gallatin Valley) and recent organizational work between MIJA (comprised of 5 immigrant community members of color) and Salud y Comunidad (which is made up of a majority of Mexican migrant community members). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It is an independent 501(c)3 organization registered in Idaho.  In its 20 year history, the ACLU of Idaho has grown from 300 to 2,000 members and from two volunteer staff members to seven full-time and one part-time staff member, supported by a growing intern and volunteer program.  We achieve our mission through public education, litigation and advocacy. Our affiliated 501(c)4 organization, the ACLU of Idaho, lobbies at the state and local level.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years the ACLU of Idaho has organized an immigrant rights conference, worked with other allies to stop anti-immigrant bills in the legislature and have partnered up with the Coalition for Immigrant Rights of Idaho in organizing immigrants and supporters to press for comprehensive immigration reform.  In other civil rights areas we\u2019ve championed efforts in Idaho to reform the public defender system to ensure fair representation in the courts.  We have organized communities in four large cities to pass a non-discrimination ordinance to protect LGBT individuals from discrimination. \r\n\r\nWe conduct educational events and community organizing throughout the state on a myriad of civil rights issues. We have organized a \u201cCivil Rights Film Series,\u201d a statewide conference on Immigrants\u2019 Rights, brown-bag \u201cLaw & Liberty\u201d Series on constitutional topics, conducting post-show discussions at plays like The Laramie Project: 10 Years Later and Stop Kiss, a Reproductive Justice Summit as well as speakers and debates on civil liberties issues ranging from same-sex marriage to separation of church and state. We conduct \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d trainings around the state for schools, groups and the general public. Our legal program fields over 3,800 complaints annually and responds to an additional 1,800 requests for assistance.",

    "narrative3": "ACLU\u2019s mission is to protect the fundamental rights that all people deserve. For immigrant community members it\u2019s often a struggle to live in this country with full rights. Liberties that the average person enjoys are often compromised for immigrants. Take for example, the ability to drive to work or school without fear of being stopped or racially profiled by law enforcement, or the ability to fair representation and due process in criminal court if accused of a crime.  \r\n\r\nThis environment of insecurity and uncertainty leads to immigrants, either not knowing or not using their constitutional rights, or government simply not respecting and honoring their constitutional rights. The ACLU works with community members so that they can understand and exercise their rights. By doing this we build collective power to organize for social change and leave a lasting impact on people\u2019s lives that empowers them to fight for change, regardless of their immigration or economic status. \r\n\r\nIdaho\u2019s rich history of agriculture is intertwined with a history of immigrant labor.  Regrettably, as immigrants, specifically Latino immigrants settled in Idaho they have been disenfranchised by the cutting out of basic resources and the vilification of their presence in the state. With a gap in language and access to education, coupled with the continued and intense threat of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, immigrants\u2019 rights are in jeopardy. \r\n\r\nComprehensive immigration reform is critical for securing the rights of immigrants and the ACLU of Idaho is committed to working toward that end. Congressional Representative Raul Labrador is a key target in the effort to pass federal immigration reform. Organizing immigrants, some who are Congressman Labrador\u2019s former clients, gives voice to those most impacted by the policy. The ACLU of Idaho, through existing relationships and partnership with the Coalition for Immigrant Rights has been organizing immigrants and allies to pressure Congressman Labrador to take leadership. \r\n\r\nOn August 13, 2013, the ACLU worked with the Coalition for Immigrant Rights to turnout immigrants and supporters to a town hall discussion with Congressman Raul Labrador. Some of the conversations that occurred at the town hall were deeply disturbing. One woman, a self-proclaimed member of the Tea Party, mentioned that she no longer recognized her country. She was concerned about the Mexican \u201claw-breakers\u201d that were entering her country illegally. She stressed that her European ancestors came here, worked hard, and then legally paid for their families to come over.  Immigrants and supporters were also shocked that only Anglo surnames were chosen to ask questions of Mr. Labrador. Incidents such as this show the blatant disregard for the rights of immigrants who call this state their home. It\u2019s critical for the ACLU to continue to organize immigrants and hold government officials accountable.",

    "narrative4": "For several months, the ACLU of Idaho has been organizing on immigration reform with the assistance of our Immigrant Rights Fellow, a position that was funded by our national office. The work plan is structured like a political campaign, with definite targets, tactics, outcomes and community organizing. We are mobilizing community members through phone banks and face-to-face meetings with unusual allies (white, Republican allies) as well as labor and business groups.  We are also organizing by using earned and paid media.  We are in the process of producing short video stories of Aspiring Americans that will be used in a social media campaign.  We have also produced a short 30 second commercial with the voice and story of an Aspiring American that is running in both mainstream radio and Spanish radio. The ads have a call to action to call Congressman to support immigration reform. \r\n\r\nThe ACLU of Idaho requests funds to continue a strong multi-prong campaign for the remainder of this year and continue next year.. \r\n\r\nOur goals for the remainder of the year include: \r\n\u2022 Continue outreach and direct organizing with immigrants through participation in the national  mobilization on October 5th and any other strategic actions. \r\n\u2022 Continue to mobilize non-immigrant supporters through repetitive radio spots, specifically targeting women 25-45 years of age on a popular radio station. \r\n\u2022 Phone banks with patch-through calls to members of Congress. \r\n\u2022 Earned and paid media. \r\n\r\nThese radio spots, as well as other key parts of the campaign are part of a comprehensive campaign to affect immediate change. We believe, along with several other community-minded organizations, by organizing immigrants and mainstream voters to act on immigration reform, we can force Congressman Labrador to act as well.  ", 
    "narrative5": "The ACLU of Idaho is fortunate to partner with many local groups. The Idaho Community Action Network (ICAN) is one such grassroots group. Through our collaborative work we are able to increase our mobilization numbers and share information and resources. Our joint work is done through the Coalition for Immigrant Rights of Idaho. Through this collaboration, ACLU of Idaho is able to reach more community members at the local level. The ACLU acts as an equal partner, providing space, professional services, time and funding.\r\n\r\nWe also collaborate with Planned Parenthood of the Northwest to advance women\u2019s rights in Idaho. Over the last several years we have been successful in organizing our members and the general public to defeat anti-choice legislation.  In 2011 we made national news when we stopped legislation aimed at forcing women and their doctors to have an ultrasound done before seeking terminating a pregnancy.  No exceptions. \r\n\r\nOn free speech and holding government accountable, we collaborate with Occupy Boise. At our last Town Hall with Rep. Labrador, Occupy Boise turned out their members in support of immigration reform.  We are in the process of strengthening our partnership with labor unions in Idaho. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have also continued communication with our legislators and encouraged them to speak in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. Key political groups such as City Club of Boise and state lecture forums have proven to be fruitful associations to gather support. We have experimented with these tools to great success and are eager to continue our work. ", 
    "narrative6": " ACLU Idaho\u2019s three priority areas, immigration reform, LGBT non-discrimination and criminal justice reform, all affect communities who face oppression and vulnerability from those in power.  Racist anti-immigrant policies, homophobic acts of violence or oppression and lack of fair representation in courts or jails are all too common in the lives of some of the people we work with. \r\n\r\nState and local involvement in immigration enforcement has led to racial discrimination in policing practices. Nationally the ACLU has been at the forefront of challenging racial profiling laws and practices. In Idaho, we have stopped anti-immigrant proposal at the legislature. We also conduct Know Your Rights training to immigrant communities so that they are better prepared when confronted with law enforcement. \r\n\r\nRacial profiling distances communities from state and local police, and thereby undermines community policing efforts that have reduced violent crime by building trust with victims and witnesses. Immigration reform should include a ban on racial profiling by all federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, as well as robust training and data collection requirements to ensure the ban\u2019s efficacy. \r\n\r\nACLU of Idaho is championing non-discrimination laws in cities across the state and organizing to amend the Idaho Human Rights Act to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. We been successful in hand of cities and have active campaigns.  On immigration reform we are also working to ensure same-sex partners are protected and included in immigration reform. \r\n\r\nThese three issues are equally represented in our office and through our outreach, advocacy and education programs. We currently have a Communications & Advocacy Director, an Immigrant Rights Fellow, an LGBT Fellow and an Outreach Coordinator that bring light to these concerns on a state and national level. This team often works together to ensure that we are leveraging our resources efficiently and effectively. \r\n\r\nOur office is diverse with representation from the LGBT and Latino communities as well as having allies in other communities. This is crucial to our success in grassroots organizing as well as at the capitol building.",

    "cycle_question": "The ACLU is an equal partner with national organizations who participate in the Alliance for Citizenship, a broad coalition working on immigration reform with a roadmap to citizenship. We support legislation that came out of the U.S. Senate and are working to strengthen its provisions to ensure immigrants are protected from racial profiling, gain access to the courts and have a clear path to citizenship. \r\n\r\nThe constitutional protections of due process and equal protection apply to everyone in the United States, including non-citizens\u2014even those not here lawfully. The ACLU of Idaho is dedicated to preserving and defending the rights of all immigrants and refugees in accordance with the Constitution.  Our work is conducted through policy advocacy and public education. \r\n\r\nThe immigration reform campaign has opened up opportunities for the ACLU, primarily a white organization, to organize within the immigrant community. Rights guaranteed to all people are particularly in jeopardy for immigrants and communities of color. The immigration reform campaign is a bridge for us to conduct our work in these communities. To aid the organization in Idaho, our Communications and Advocacy Director, Leo Morales, has been orchestrating the campaign. Leo, an immigrant from Oaxaca, Mexico, has been using his personal experience as well as his professional history as organizer with the Idaho Community Action Network, to lead our efforts and fully engage the community.  This particular campaign has the potential to significantly grow our base and diversify our members. \r\n\r\nImmigration reform must create a welcoming roadmap to citizenship for aspiring Americans living in and contributing to the U.S. Fundamental fairness as guaranteed by the Constitution requires that these individuals be brought within the legal embrace of U.S. citizenship. Legalization of aspiring citizens will help restore fairness to an immigration system under which 1.5 million people have been deported at staggering cost in the last four years, leaving hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizen children without parents, and tens of thousands in foster care. Immigration reform should recognize that state and local governments cannot interfere with or usurp federal immigration authority or violate constitutional rights in the name of immigration enforcement. \r\n\r\nLegislatively, the ACLU of Idaho has partnered with other organizations to vigorously defend the rights of immigrants in the state.  In 2010 we defeated three proposals that combined would have curtailed the rights of immigrants in employment, exposed them to increased incidence of racial profiling, as well limit the rights of U.S. Citizens\u2019 and legal immigrants\u2019 from accessing public benefits. \r\nTrough our involvement with immigration reform our organizational capacity to stop xenophobic legislation will increase. We will build long-term relationships and leadership with the immigrant/Latino community that will lend itself to future civil rights campaigns, whether at the state or national level.  Our mission to protect the rights of all people as guaranteed by the federal and state Constitutions will only be reinforced by new members and allies within the immigrant community. ",

Entre Hermanos gained non-profit status in 2001 and has been providing advocacy, education, support and referrals primarily in the areas of HIV and STD Prevention, Tobacco Prevention, Recovery Support, Youth Development, Lesbian Health, Immigration advocacy and referrals.\r\nOur outreach efforts also reach non-LGBT Latinos with education and advocacy. We regularly offer presentations at non-LGBT Latino conferences and gatherings, to build bridges and promote inclusion.

We also conduct outreach at the Mexican Consulate each month and at a variety of health fairs that focus on the Latino community.\r\nAfter the economic recession of 2008, Entre Hermanos underwent a strategic planning process and added community organizing and mobilization to its scope of work. We have participated in coalitions advocating for racial, economic, and LGBTQ justice; establishing and nurturing relationships with others in the community who hold similar goals. \r\nWe participated in the marriage equality campaign in 2012, and in 2013 we are involved in the drive for comprehensive immigration reform.

    "narrative3": "* We work with a community that is mainly immigrant, LGBTQ, Spanish speaking, and working class and may or may not have legal residency in the U.S. This is a community with great resiliency and resourcefulness that faces many challenges on a daily basis. Our community is intersectional, in that its characterized by ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender expression. We work to address the challenges that emerge from oppression that is experienced because of those very characteristics.\r\n* We would argue that the root causes are an unjust economic system that exploits workers; racism directed at Latinos; homophobia, sexism and transphobia. In terms of immigration reform, we recognize that factors like the North American Free Trade Agreement have contributed greatly to economic misery in Latin America that has driven alot of the human migration to the U.S. in search of work and money to send back home. In addition, the need for cheap labor in the US also creates the conditions of exploitation that adversely affect the immigrant community we work with.\r\n* Honestly, we are in the process right now of discovering and determining how to build collective power. For more than 20 years Entre Hermanos has been successful at mobilizing the Latino queer community for gay pride events and for gatherings that are focused on health and culture. We are now in the middle of capitalizing on that ability and translating it to mobilization for community power and influence over the issues that affect daily life and the larger systems that oppress. We are getting help in this process, most recently by participating in the Western States Center's Communities United initiative, which is providing us with technical assistance for community organizing. \r\n* One of the ways that our work can bring about change is by raising the voice of the community we serve through organizing for change. We are developing community leadership so that the community determines its priorities and brings its own voice to the conversations. Low income immigrant working LGBTQ people are the most affected by the injustices we recognize, and we intend to elevate their voices in the conversations that strategize how to make change. An important part of that process is building capacity within the community. This summer we sent two people to the AMP training in Portland; one staff person and one community volunteer.    ",

In that case our work will be to continue mobilizing community to have conversations about what the road ahead looks like and where we need to invest our efforts.

There is much work to do in protecting the rights of immigrants who are in this country without documents. \r\nWorker rights or access to health care could take precedence if an immigration reform bill is not passed by congress this year.

    "cycle_question": "We have not taken a formal position on immigration reform, but we continue to be engaged in the conversation by participating with the Immigration Roundtable based in Seattle, and we have mobilized volunteers to help with phone banking in support of CIR. \r\nIn addition we have supported the efforts of QUIP (Queer Undocumented Immigrant Project), which includes some members of our Seattle queer undocumented youth community. These inspiring young people have provided courageous and tireless leadership in highlighting issues like the separation of families. At the same time they have recognized that an immigration reform that benefits Dreamers and leaves behind their families would be an injustice. This type of distinction is very important for immigration activist to recognize, in our estimation.\r\nIn previous iterations of the Dream Act, we also noted that in order to qualify, young people would either have to be enrolled in college or the military. Given the lack of affordability of higher education, and the historic exclusion of students of color from educational access, we felt this Dream Act requirement created a pipeline to military service which might not be in the best interest of our communities. Especially in light of our country\u2019s propensity for starting questionable wars in the post-911 era, funneling young immigrants into military service seems like a very bad deal. \r\nWe recognize the very political nature of the debate going on in congress, which has led for instance to the Senate bill which would result in a multi-billion dollar militarization of  the border with Mexico, and which includes many obstacles on the path to citizenship for immigrants. \r\nFor us the bigger picture is about social justice for immigrants, and for queer latino immigrants in particular. The types of issues included are about access to employment, health care, safe community space and basic dignity. Our community organizing work very organically includes this type of work. After this year, and presumably the conclusion of the immigration reform work in the U.S. Congress, we will focus (as mentioned elsewhere in the application) either on educating the community about the reforms that did get enacted; or else turning our attention to other immigrant rights issues enumerated above. This work will carry forward at the city, county and state level. \r\nIn recent years we have very intentionally participated as a queer organization in the immigrant rights march on May 1st in Seattle. Of course we were not the first LGBT group to do this, but we are uniquely situated as a Latino organization with a natural affinity for both immigrant rights and queer liberation. Bringing the rainbow flag and signs proclaiming \"Queers for Immigration Reform\" to the May Day march was a beautiful way of uniting these common struggles and also showing both communities that this intersection exists. \r\n",

ICAN\u2019s work focuses on strategies to combat poverty, including promoting access to health care, racial justice, food security, wages, and pocketbook issues such as utilities. ICAN utilizes community organizing, advocacy, direct action, and leadership development to advance the systematic change required to lift low-income Idahoans out of poverty.\r\n\r\nICAN\u2019s programs seek to improve the lives of low-income Idahoans. Of our 2,000 members, 85 percent are low-income - live in urban and rural areas and include both long-term residents of Idaho and new immigrants. The core issues that ICAN works on are:\r\n\r\nImmigrant Organizing: ICAN is organizing the immigrant community by building individual membership and training and developing their leadership, organizing a nonprofit radio station and a statewide coalition of institutions interested in immigration reform.  \r\n\r\nImmigrant Integration: ICAN is working with several organizations, to provide assistance in naturalization, to register new citizens to vote, and to encourage young immigrant students to pursue higher education. \r\n\r\nFood Security: ICAN has 6 local programs around the state that distribute donated food to members. Members in these programs also pool their money together to purchase food in bulk. \r\n\r\nHealth Care: ICAN advocates for quality, accessible and affordable health care for all. As part of regional and national coalitions, ICAN won SCHIP reauthorization including the option to remove the five-year bar on immigrant children\u2019s eligibility. ICAN played a key role in turning Representative Simpson\u2019s \u201cno\u201d vote into a \u201cyes\u201d during this campaign.\r\n\r\nLeadership Development: ICAN is committed to ensuring that low-income members and the specific constituencies impacted by the issues we work on play a leading role in the organization\u2019s decision making processes.",

    "narrative3": "ICAN prioritizes issues that address racial, social, and economic inequalities with an understanding that the root cause of these inequalities is low income and communities of color not having the political clout necessary to advance their interests.  ICAN supports a platform with five principles that dig deep down into the root causes of poverty:\r\n\r\nFAIR LENDING-fair access to credit that is non-discriminatory and non-predatory, stopping preventable foreclosures and fair banking practices.\r\nFAIR PUBLIC FINANCE-restore funding for education and vital health services.\r\nFAIR TAXES-end tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and make them pay their fair share\r\nFAIR EMPLOYMENT-living wages and job security\r\nFAIR IMMIGRATION REFORM\u00ac-comprehensive reform that supports family unity and a path to citizenship\r\n  \r\nICAN builds collective power through community organizing. Currently, the strategies we are using to build collective power include:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIndividual recruitment- door knocking, phone canvass,  home visits, house meetings\r\n\u2022\tInstitutional recruitment-meetings and  presentations with churches, education and labor groups\r\n\u2022\tCommunity recruitment- direct outreach to immigrant communities and small businesses through the radio station broadcasting\r\n\u2022\tCoalition building-continuously building power-sometimes with unlikely allies \r\n\r\nICAN educates new leaders about how our economic system and racism work together to create the inequity that is prevalent in our country. ICAN empowers leaders to address these underlying systems through collective action of issues.   ICAN believes that once leaders are trained, they become the best organizers for building local program bases.  ICAN members have many opportunities to receive training and education on issues and community organizing through:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tLocal issue education training\r\n\u2022\tLocal one-day community organizing training\r\n\u2022\tLocal skill development training-speech and writing \r\n\u2022\tRegional four-day organizer training\r\n\u2022\tRegional leadership development- training leaders to be trainers\r\n\r\nICAN leaders actively invest in and build strong state and national coalitions.  While we organize key constituencies in an often overlooked geography we will not make the changes we care about alone.    \r\n\r\n\u2022\tState Coalition building:  ICAN has worked to build state coalitions for Immigration Reform, on Medicaid and Pay Day lending.  These coalitions include: labor, churches, Latino and farm worker organizations, small businesses, service organizations and disability groups \r\n\r\n\u2022\tNational Coalitions: Alliance For A Just Society, New Bottom Line, Fair Immigration Reform Movement, National People\u2019s Action and National Council of La Raza. \r\n\r\nICAN brings analysis, policy, people from impacted communities, and an action orientation to these coalitions.\r\n\r\nIn Idaho, progressive systemic change is often challenging given the conservative climate in the state.  ICAN works to educate disenfranchised Idahoans using an ideology that represents a value of fairness; a value that is often absent from the conservative dialogue.  It is through this value of fairness that ICAN builds a power base that will collectively change the power dynamics and alter the political climate of the state.\r\n",

Our goals and objectives focus on winning concrete victories with fair lending, fair public financing and fair immigration reform.\r\nOver the next year, ICAN will take a multi-prong approach to address the predatory lending issue and takes both local and state based plans.  \r\n\r\nFirst, working with Mayor Nancolas, ICAN will organize a local campaign in the city of Caldwell for a city ordinance that will drive predatory lenders out of the city.  Second, ICAN will reach out to surrounding communities in the Treasure Valley and press for a collective action by the Treasure Valley Partnership to institute similar city ordinances that will drive predatory lenders out of the Treasure Valley. The third prong is moving a larger state wide campaign that gets to the heart of the predatory lending issue with a state rate cap of 36% on all loan products.  \r\n\r\nICAN will continue work with the Medicaid Matters coalition to secure funding of healthcare for all Idahoan\u2019s up to 138% of the poverty level.  Expanding Medicaid will help move our goal of fair financing of public programs in Idaho.  With years of cuts to education, mental, dental and physical health, our plan to ensure funding for our most vulnerable populations will include outreach and base building with people directly impacted.\r\n\r\nFinally, ICAN will continue to support a larger campaign for fair immigration reform. With a strong desire to bring families out of the shadows and allow them compete fairly and safely in our economy we will continue support a national solution.  ICAN will continue to engage all communities in the value the immigrant communities bring to our economy.\r\n\r\nWe will assess meeting our objectives based on concrete victories.\r\n",

Adding to the previous list of national affiliations, ICAN also prioritizes state collaborations as a strategy for building a more progressive climate and to win on local issues in Idaho.\r\n\r\nState Level: ICAN will continue to coordinate the Coalition for Immigrant Rights of Idaho (members include ACLU of Idaho, Community Council of Idaho, Salazar Law, Andrade Legal, Center for Community and Justice, Catholic Charities of Idaho, UFWC, SEIU, and AFL-CIO, community leaders, and students from the University of Idaho and Boise State, and KBWE in Burley Idaho) which is in charge of coordinating the October 5th mass mobilization.\r\n\r\nNational Level: ICAN is a member of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement and continues to work with them around immigration reform. ICAN is also affiliated with the Alliance for a Just Society, which supports the organization with planning and implementation of campaigns. In addition to this, ICAN is also sitting in the field committee of the Alliance for Citizenship table. At the regional level, ICAN collaborated with PCUN, CAUSA, and OneAmerica on the Northwest Immigrant Rights Bus Tour - and currently working on a immigration cross-train in Bend OR during September.\r\n\r\nICAN\u2019s approach to organizing for immigration reform and immigrant rights is a based in ICAN\u2019s deeply held core values, which include:  \r\n\u2022\tHuman Dignity\r\n\u2022\tFairness\r\n\u2022\tEquity and  \r\n\u2022\tJustice \r\n\r\nThese core values are used to bridge differences and build unity.

It is critical to bridge the growing racial divide in rural America. Race based policies are often used to polarize and mobilize the white working class against their economic interest by shading the real issues. It is critical to organize in white communities, to inoculate them against such attacks and to move them into alliances with immigrant and native populations where they reside.   That is the work that ICAN does and we have shown the ability to foster the bridge between white and Latino Idahoans on hunger issues, Foodstamps (SNAP), etc. \r\n\r\nThe majority of ICAN events combine leaders from a broad base of communities including immigrant communities and communities of color along with white communities that are rural and tend to be very conservative. We have found that our best campaigns and greatest successes are those that include a strong and broad base and where the issue encompasses racial, social and economic justice.

Since our founding in 1998, we have supported our member organizations with trainings in strategic planning, organizing skills, organizational development, evaluation and more. \r\n\r\nEnlace has coordinated several international campaigns and developed an Integrated Organizing Approach (IOA) that we teach to member organizations; this approach has been critical to our successes in winning complex, multi-faceted campaigns. The IOA combines internal capacity building techniques with strategic campaign development to cultivate dynamic and effective campaigns.

This campaign won landmark victories for workers, including the first union neutrality agreement in Mexico's maquiladora industry. \r\n\r\nEnlace currently has two main programmatic areas that advance the rights and self-determination of working people and communities of color: the Enlace Institute, in which we teach the IOA tools and work with organizations individually to advance their work, and the National Private Prison Divestment Campaign, which we developed in consultation with our member organizations in response to the crisis in immigrant detentions and deportations. \r\n\r\nWe launched the campaign in 2011, and we have already won several victories, including: \r\n\u2022\tThe United Methodist Church and its pension fund wholly divested from private prisons. \r\n\u2022\tPershing Square Capital Management, at the time the largest shareholder in Corrections Corporation of America, divested all of its holdings. \r\n\u2022\tWells Fargo divested 33% of its GEO Group stock in late 2012 and another 36% in the first quarter of 2013.

Employers exploit low-wage immigrant workers in a variety of ways including wage theft, payment below the minimum wage and threats of deportation when workers try to assert their right to organize. Members of Enlace and our member organizations have felt these impacts first-hand, and we firmly believe that the solution lies in our ability to fight back and build community power. \r\n\r\nRight now, many of Enlace\u2019s member organizations are intensely involved in the Comprehensive Immigration Reform fight.

We also know that there will be millions of undocumented people who will be left out of CIR, even in a best-case scenario. According to Senate figures, the number of people at risk for arrest, detention and deportation over the next year will be at least 4 million. For this reason, it remains as urgent as ever to tackle one of the root causes of unjust immigration policy: the private, for-profit prison and immigrant detention industry. \r\n\r\nAnti-immigrant bills pushed by the private prison industry have become law and have packed the jails, literally changing the face of the US prison population. Immigration cases made up 36% of all federal criminal prosecutions nationwide in 2011, and Latinos now make up more than half of the federal prison population, despite representing only 16% of the total US population. As George Zoley, Chairman, CEO and founder of GEO Group, stated, \"The main driver for the growth of new beds at the federal level continues to be the detention and incarceration of criminal aliens.\" Tragically, the incarceration of immigrants has become big business. \r\n\r\nTo address the root causes of anti-immigrant and other racist legislation, it is imperative that, in addition to deconstructing the ubiquitous racism in our culture, we expose and sever the financial ties that allow shareholders to cash in on the incarceration of immigrants and people of color. The private prison industry\u2019s lobby, bolstered by the support of financial investors like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, is the moving force behind the massive arrest and incarceration rate among low wage immigrant workers and people of color. \r\n\r\nIn the process of organizing our communities to exert pressure on financial institutions and other large investors (cities, universities, institutions of faith, etc.), we are also building our skills, relationships and power for the long haul.

Key political targets include Representatives Blumenauer, Bonamici, Beutler, Wyden, Merkley, Cantwell and Murray in Oregon and Washington. \r\n\u2022\tSupporting partner organizations in local prison development site fights. \r\n\u2022\tCoordinating and publicizing actions targeting corporate investors in the private prison industry, such as Wells Fargo and Scopia Management. \r\n\r\nFor the remainder of 2013, Enlace will work with local allies to pressure the City of Portland and the University of California to divest from private prisons. In 2014 and forward, these resolutions will serve as models to replicate in other cities across the country. We will also build on the exposure gained through these efforts to pressure decision-makers to stop supporting private prisons. \r\n\r\nEnlace works with the staff and members of the campaign\u2019s participating organizations to educate the public and carry out community organizing activities. In this organizing work we reach out to immigrant communities in particular, as leadership development and capacity building within the most affected communities remains a priority alongside our other campaign goals. \r\n\r\nWe assess our work using the Evaluation Star framework, an evaluation process that measures not only the accomplishments of the campaign, including new individuals and groups who become involved, but also deals with issues such as capability (skills gained or needed) and capacity.", 
    "narrative5": "Enlace is the national convener of the National Private Prison Divestment Campaign, which includes over 145 organizations in 21 states. In addition to supporting local prison site fights and implementing divestment strategies, the we are ultimately working toward long-term systemic and structural change. We are a national alliance of networks and organizations representing immigrant, labor, faith, criminal justice focused and prison abolitionist communities. Our long term goal is that after private prisons are a part of history, the alliances formed through this campaign will continue to thrive and the social justice movement at large will be stronger because of the cross-sector and cross-cultural relationships we are building now. \r\n\r\nThe Campaign Steering Committee has a Movement Building Subcommittee that recruits new campaign partners who represent constituencies that are negatively impacted by the prison industry. Recently this subcommittee reached out to criminal justice and African American organizations such as The New Jim Crow and African Methodist Episcopal churches. A broad base of immigrant-led organizations is already involved, such as the Center for Intercultural Organizing and VOZ in Portland, One America, El Comit\u00e9 Pro Reforma and Casa Latina in Seattle. \r\n\r\nIn addition to coordinating national campaign activities, Enlace also works to foster deeper relationships with organizations on the front lines of struggles for justice. Here in Portland, we have an ongoing collaboration with Voz, part of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON). Both of our organizations share a commitment to strategic engagement and capacity-building in the communities most impacted by racism, worker exploitation, increased immigration enforcement and other problems facing our communities. \r\n\r\nWe believe in collective liberation and organize from a place of intersectionality and recognition of our common struggle to realize respect for our rights and dignity.

    "cycle_question": "Enlace has not taken a formal position on the CIR bill, however many of our member organizations are very involved in the debate. We have chosen to focus on the people who we know will be left out of any immigration reform law; this figure is at least 4 million people based on what we know of the Senate bill and funding earmarked for immigration enforcement. While other organizing efforts centered around CIR are certainly important, we feel that it is equally important to keep our eye on the prize of defeating one of the biggest root causes of the dramatic growth in immigrant detentions and deportations: the private, for-profit prison industry. Until the profit motive is removed from prison and immigration policy, this industry will remain a major obstacle to achieving any just immigration policy, and we will continue to see devastating impacts in immigrant communities and other communities of color. \r\n\r\nThis is certainly a historic moment in the national dialogue around immigration and immigration reform. We are utilizing this opportunity to raise the issue of unjust treatment of immigrants, and to join together with other justice-oriented organizations to build on our existing campaigns. As well as raise our collective voices nationally we must also remember to use this political moment to build capacity on the local level and move our community-based fights forward. ",

    "narrative3": "Casa Latina was formed with the intention of building a space for Latino immigrant workers to look for work under a roof which they could call home, while also offering educational opportunities to increase employability and their ability to be active community participants. We recognize that this community struggles with isolation, various systems of oppression, and lack of knowledge about the country\u2019s systems and its democratic processes as well as other issues related to their immigration status. \r\nCurrently, the Latino immigrant community is trying to survive a perfect storm of a broken immigration system and a weak economy.  Contraction in the construction, restaurant and hotel industries coupled with the skittishness of employers about having undocumented workers on the payroll has led to massive layoffs among the Latino immigrant community.   Immigrants have experienced increased fear of deportation and decreased economic security. Before the recession, a chance for informal labor through Casa Latina was the first stop for new arrivals; now we have also become the safety net for people who have settled here but have lost their jobs.  \r\nThe result of the current national policy is an immigrant community under great stress, fearful of being caught and separated from family and loved ones, while at the same time struggling to find any type of work, even under unfair, unsafe or illegal working conditions.  \r\n Within our work, we provide a space in which the members can practice democracy and collective power. They make decisions about the value of their work, for example, starting in April of this year, they set the minimum wage for jobs dispatched through the worker center at $15 an hour. \r\nWorker members hold a weekly assembly through which they make decisions that affect their lives and demand transparency when issues arise related to the organization. This assembly also serves as a community forum in which they can follow up on the rules that they have established to make sure they are being followed properly or to make adjustments when it\u2019s time to update their policies. They have also developed a system to elect representatives who will represent them at conventions, congresses and other events that attend as well as a mechanism to take a position on political issues that affect them directly. \r\nThrough this analysis, the workers become conscious of the social context in which they are living.  At the same time, living in a new country allows them to come out of their isolation. Achieving awareness about the democratic process and other systems of oppression of which they are victims have been the primary steps towards their leadership development. \r\n",

    "narrative5": "Casa Latina participates in multiple coalitions and collaborates on various campaigns. This year, we participated in the formation of a new group, The Immigration Roundtable, comprised of community organizations, legal advocacy groups, and faith communities.  Its purpose is to collaborate on efforts to move fair and just immigration reform legislation. Through participation, we have been able to take concrete steps to push for immigration reform and have built a broad group that can support each other on efforts related to immigrant rights; it allows us the opportunity to act unified on progressive campaigns such as immigration reform, which is key to creating effective change within social movements.  \r\nCasa Latina is a founding member of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. We are a member of its Board and locally we represent the following campaigns:\r\n\u2022\tCaring Across Generations, a national movement of care recipients, providers and families that come together to share stories and work together in local communities to realize justice around care in America\r\n\u2022\tWe Belong Together, a campaign to mobilize women in support of common-sense immigration reform that will keep families together and empower women\r\n\r\nThe National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) is another alliance of which Casa Latina is a member, representing the Northwest within its Board.  NDLON is dedicated to improving the lives of day laborers through 40 worker centers across the US. Casa Latina has participated in Immigration Reform campaign through efforts including: \u201cNot 1 More Deportation\u201d, by organizing a 6 day fast in July along with 12 other local organizations, in order to bring a moral voice to the immigration debate to move the President and Congress to relieve the suffering of families separated by deportation and move forward with inclusive reform. Between 90 and 100 people fasted across the state.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "We recognize that our members are victims of neoliberalism in their own countries and when they arrive here, they confront racial and economic disparities. As an organization that primarily works with new immigrants, we are acutely aware of the lack of access within healthcare, education, and work and other institutions. The disadvantages faced due to lack of language access and immigration status makes our community more vulnerable. We provide access to work, education and other services by providing access to jobs and ESL classes so immigrants can create better relationships with employers and can sustain their families here and back home. \r\nBy developing the leadership of domestic workers and day laborers, we are building the strength and power of a community that historically has been marginalized and made invisible, who have been left out of the protections for most other workers, and who don\u2019t always have equal access to healthcare. \r\nWe combat stereotypes in which certain low-income groups are seen as uneducated and unworthy by providing education, leadership development and a way for members to make decisions about issues that impact their lives. \r\nThrough our programs, we are purposefully acting as inclusively as possible to combat gender oppression and homophobia. During the last couple years, as part of the renewal process for membership and in order to access our services, all members were required to participate in both an LBGTQ Rights and a Gender Equity workshop. We were also part of the leadership of a coalition seeking to bring together the Latino immigrant community and the LGBTQ community. \r\nOne of the visions for the members of Casa Latina is that they are able to fully participate in this democratic society. That is why immigration reform is such an important fight. To this end, we have been able to take advantage of opportunities which have taken us to Washington DC in order to lobby for immigration reform and more protections for vulnerable workers through the creation of an Office for Excluded Workers at the federal level. Whenever possible, the membership elects representatives who can advocate for the interests of day laborers and domestic workers. This has allowed them access to political power, which they might not have ever been able to access otherwise. \r\nFor Casa Latina, combining direct services with community organizing is of great importance.  We are currently engaged in several campaigns that involve a lot organizing work; we are constantly facing funding issues for this work. Even though Casa Latina has a stable budget of over $1M, the funding for our organizing work is less $100,000.  This grant would make a difference for our organizing work, providing additional resources at a critical time when organizing work is desperately needed.     \r\n",

    "cycle_question": "Casa Latina is a democratic organization in which the members make the decisions that affect their own lives. For this reason, the Board of Directors supported the membership to make the final decision about how we would engage with the current immigration reform proposal for the whole of the organization. The decision was finalized after two member assemblies; one with the day laborers and the other with the domestic workers. They came to the decision to continue supporting SB744, the Senate\u2019s immigration reform proposal. They believe that this is the most concrete opportunity to achieve citizenship. Although this is not a perfect proposal, they recognize that it includes the necessities of day laborers and domestic workers within its requirements. \r\nAs part of the National Day Labor Organizing Network and National Domestic Workers Alliance, we take their lead on national efforts such as immigration reform. At this time, neither organization has opposed the Senate\u2019s Bill. Still, both of these groups are pushing the current administration to stop deportations in order to keep families together through several campaigns such as Not One More Deportation, We Belong Together, and the state legislative proposal known as the TRUST Act. \r\nThrough these campaigns we have been able to keep  our members informed about the different proposals as well as the advances of such proposals within Congress, but with limited resources we have not been able to adequately participate and bring to light the needs of workers to our Congress members who have the ultimate decision on whether this legislation passes or fails.  \r\nWith support from the Social Justice Fund we will be able to develop an informed, broad and unified leadership of day laborers and domestic workers, which will also include workers who congregate on street corners, in order to create a movement that achieves an immigration reform proposal which takes into account these same voices. \r\n",

    "narrative1": "Kitsap Immigrant Assistance Center began in 2004 providing a central location dedicated to helping immigrants in our community, and connecting them with people and organizations that also help. (Examples: The DSHS, the YMCA domestic violence counselor, and the monthly West Sound Free Clinic health van are available at our location.) Our reputation grew particularly because of the way we help clients with individual needs, and because our compassionate and efficient Executive Director, Martitha May, who is paid a minimal amount for her office hours on Mondays and Tuesdays, is available 24/7 on the KIAC cell phone.  We help clients understand their doctor's instructions and help doctors understand their patient's symptoms, help the homeless find housing, the jobless find work; we assist with job and housing applications and read mail; we provide ESL and health and nutrition classes, with cooking demonstrations and meals when the funding permits.\r\nRecently, the situations these immigrants bring to our office (staffed in part by volunteer immigrants) have prompted us to increase our focus on the legal needs of our clients.  KIAC has recruited volunteers to receive extensive in-person and online training and guidance to become Bureau of Immigration Assistance (BIA) accredited representatives to provide immigration legal services. Five of our volunteers will be begin intensive training in September. Our first course is \"Prepare for Bureau of Immigration Assistance (BIA) Recognition and Accreditation.\"  This will be followed by at least six more ELearning classes listed in our activities section. The volunteer expectation is that as BIA accredited representatives, we will work in conjunction with Kitsap Legal Services (KLS) attorneys to provide free or low cost legal assistance, available through KIAC. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "KIAC has been great at listening to immigrants and matching them up with the local resources that are available to them. In these times of shrinking budgets for social services, great creativity has been necessary to locate needed services. However, it is becoming more obvious weekly that the need for legal assistance, particularly concerning immigration issues overwhelms our ability to provide help. Currently we seek help with applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and domestic violence issues; we deal with variety of other immigration issues, most especially those involving keeping families together.  Additionally we are concerned about the structure and quality of justice accorded to immigrants caught in the enforcement net, as well as representation for those forced to prove themselves innocent of immigration violations, regardless of their legal status. The failure to provide representation and fair process to immigrants has been identified by the Immigration Policy Center as one of the ways our immigration system falls short of the America ideals of justice. We plan to work in a manageable, local way to make others aware of this and ultimately to change this. \r\nRight now KIAC refers any legal cases to Kitsap Legal Services (KLS), a small non-profit that provides free legal assistance by volunteer attorneys to low income persons. (The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project is not easily accessible because of our location.) KLS has the structure to administer cases, but it needs additional staff and volunteers. Collectively, we plan to build our capacity to work together to handle these cases. Here\u2019s how: KIAC has recruited an initial group of 4-5 volunteers for intensive training to become Bureau of Immigration Assistance (BIA) Accredited Representatives. Kitsap Legal Services will become a BIA recognized organization officially able to supervise these volunteers. By educating and guiding 4-5 people through the classroom and ELearning courses necessary for accreditation, we will increase our ability to provide representation. Attorneys from KLS and the BIA accredited representatives (supplied by KIAC) authorized to help with immigration cases will be assisted by a third and important level of volunteers. These \u201cintake volunteers\u201d (we have commitments from several local churches) will be educated in the bare basics of immigration law. Just the process of communicating these plans, asking for volunteers, and educating them increases community awareness of immigration issues, a good strategy for us. \r\nIncreased access to legal services will enable immigrants in Kitsap, Mason, and Jefferson County (the areas we serve) to understand and exercise their legal rights. Besides being necessary for our current legal issues, we need to put these plans in place now to prepare us to build our capacity to handle potential cases when Comprehensive Immigration Reform passes.

Four to five KIAC volunteers will undertake 40 hours of  training in New York in September, followed by several E-Learning courses.  Additional volunteer training for legal assistance to immigrants will take place on multiple levels. \u201cPartially Accredited Representative\u201d candidates will attend intensive trainings and observe operating programs to gain acceptance by the BIA. We hope to have several of those representatives continue taking courses to become \"Fully Accredited Representatives.\"  Our \u201cintake volunteers\u201d will receive immigration law familiarization as well as initial interview and case management training, and the services of an interpreter as necessary. We will design a process flow: the flow will detail each step of the case process and will identify the supporting checklists and agreements.  We will develop procedures for creating, reviewing and filing cases. We will design a case technical review checklist to be used by the support attorney to review cases before filing. We will develop metrics for assessing the program progress and effectiveness.  Throughout this time, will be informing immigrants of their rights and opportunities, and seeking additional volunteers to assist in this program. During the first year the eight person advisory board will meet monthly to review procedures and results. We consider measurement a critical part of our program since data about the volume and types of immigration law services in Kitsap County have not been collected before. The Case Management Software we will be using will help us stay on track and evaluate our program from the initial intake point to the eventual results. We anticipate handling 50 consultations and 35 cases during our startup program year, preparing us for more in the following year.  \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "KIAC has begun collaboration with Kitsap Legal Services to provide better local access to legal services for immigrants. KLS is a member of the Alliance for Equal Justice, the umbrella network of civil legal aid programs for low-income populations in Washington. KLS volunteer attorneys provide legal advice to immigrants (and out-of-court translation) regardless of immigration status. KLS has the structure, the desire, and the demand to take on additional cases; it lacks sufficient accredited staff to do so. Because of this project, KLS will become an accredited Bureau of Immigration entity with attorneys,  and KIAC will provide trained and BIA accredited volunteers with sufficient training to qualify as formally \"Accredited Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nThis month KIAC was accepted as an affiliate of CLINIC, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, INC, which will provide us with better access to education, advice, and representation. We work in partnerships with St. Olaf's Catholic Church, which sustains us monthly with some operating expenses, and the West Sound Free Clinic which is piloting their mobile clinic (two former ambulances) at our location the fourth Friday of each month. Their well attended evening clinic provides medical care plus an opportunity for KIAC to let immigrants know of our other services. \r\n\r\nA third collaboration is between KIAC and the Silverdale United Methodist Church, who will provide workers to serve as \"intake volunteers\" for the clients we expect. The area UMC area Bishop,  Grant Hagiya, has signed a letter of support clearing the way for assistance from the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR).  A congregation member serves on the KIAC board. The United Methodist Women are involved in progressive Bible study inviting  participants to become part of a radical, inclusive, hospitable community and to encourage others to do likewise. \r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "A quick look around our center any Monday or Tuesday would tell you: we are a community of color, with free movement and interaction between the KIAC staff and board members and those who come for services. \r\nWe know that undocumented immigrants or those with questions related to their immigration status live in daily fear, and that they even fear seeking help. They fear being identified, detained and eventually deported and separated from loved ones. Children of undocumented parents fear that one day they will lose their parents to deportation. This overwhelming fear, which affects all aspects of their lives and those of their families leaves immigrants prey to exploitation and abuse from employers and other unethical persons. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, many immigrants do not understand the complicated immigration process and might not speak English, making them vulnerable to unscrupulous law practitioners who charge them large fees while providing little to no help and may even provide erroneous information putting them in further jeopardy. While many of the undocumented immigrants currently residing in the US are eligible for legal residency, many are not clear about how to proceed and may not be able to afford reliable representation. \r\n\r\nBy addressing the legal status of our clients as we have outlined here we hope to also give them the tools and the confidence to deal more systemically with the other issues affecting them. We acknowledge and work with the \u201ctrifecta\u201d of poor health outcomes\u2014lack of health insurance, lack of access to medical care, and a much higher incidence of preventable diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. We do this both through a nutrition and meal program (sporadic as funding permits) and through providing first-in-the-counties monthly access to a mobile medical van. Most of our work on health care is done individually: helping individuals find services and understand medical instructions. We offer ESL classes, connect clients with dedicated volunteers for individual English practice; we also connect the local Olympic College non-credit courses for non-English speakers wanting to learn how to read, write, speak, and understand English. The associate dean of this program is a member of the KIAC board. The \u201cEffects of DOMA on Immigration\u201d was a recent workshop some members attended. Homelessness, joblessness, disputes with landlords and employers are all handled individually by our volunteers. Because of all of these issues, we have chosen both continue our current work and begin our new Kitsap Legal Assistance Program. \r\n",

    "cycle_question": "The anticipation that Comprehensive Immigration with a path to citizenship will pass soon is what gives a special urgency to this grant request. Besides the legal issues our immigrants are facing, we believe approximately 6,000 undocumented people in Kitsap County may be eligible to apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant  (RPI) status after CIR is enacted. Under the plan passed by the Senate applicants will have one year after the final rule is published to apply for RPI status. Applications would have to be assisted by attorneys familiar with immigration law or Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) accredited representatives. There are currently no resources in Kitsap County that could effectively handle that many people in a timely way. The potential for unscrupulous providers, like notarios, to take advantage of this situation is high. By increasing their accredited personnel and resources, Kitsap Legal Services (KLS) and the Kitsap Immigrant Assistance Center (KIAC) could provide this service. \r\nThe very act of putting a local system in place to deal with future CIR (as well as with immigrant's current legal issues) is the kind of hopeful act that builds momentum for our organization, and that generates discussion of reform. A recent visit to a well-attended church council meeting soliciting \"intake volunteers\" and support for KIAC is a case in point.  After our presentation, pointed questions led to an awareness of the issues that would otherwise not have been discussed in this forum. \r\nCurrent discussions about immigration reform have provided the impetus to get our group going in a direction our clients have been hoping, toward more timely and accessible legal representation; have provided a forum to get our community talking  (and to get us initiating discussions) about the issues immigrants face, the laws or enforcement procedures that govern their lives, and the directions we should take from here. This is already happening: just in the process of planning this coalition for legal representation, we have had to talk with numerous community organizations, legal entities, and groups to determine just how we could accomplish our goals, and to seek support and funding for them We envision a greater need to provide community forums and education about our services when CIR passes. If it does not pass in a timely fashion our increased capacity for legal representation for immigrants and our increased knowledge of immigration laws will make many in our organization more capable of leading community forums to secure its passage, at the same time we are serving current immigration related needs for immigrants. \r\n             \r\nFile uploads note: Please see both pages below in our attached Project Budget.

    "narrative3": " We  work to overcome the racism and oppression directed at Latinos that exists in our community.  We believe that the root causes of this oppression are greed and power.   This is played out in a variety of public institutions and policies including public education, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the media (local as well as national), law enforcement, hate groups and employment.  More so, with population projections indicating that Latinos will be the majority group in the near future, white male America fears losing its position of power and dominance. So successful are the media campaigns against Latinos that they have even engaged faith groups in promoting this hate.  These rightwing groups are well organized and funded.  Our community needs to have all the available tools to combat them.  This oppression affects the entire Latino community, but we see a greater impact on our youth and their ability to \u201cbreak through\u201d the system and grow into successful, productive adults, thus perpetuating cycles of poverty and abuse.  Undocumented immigrants live in constant fear of deportation and separation from their families and continuous humiliation in the media.   Media blasts immigrants as disease carrying terrorists here only to \u201ctake\u201d from Americans and give nothing in return.  State laws prohibit undocumented immigrants from having the \u201cright\u201d to drive or even obtain identification.    This institutionalized oppression continues to marginalize Latinos and hampers their success.  The educational format of classes and workshops naturally bring people with a common interest and willingness to progress together.  Supportive alliances are formed and self esteem and awareness increase. Along with the acquisition of these tools we need to know how to most effectively utilize them\u2014leadership development. This needs to occur at all levels of our organization and our community.  Teaching leadership skills that work for and with the community are our first priority.  Leadership that leaves the community behind mimics the very oppressive forces that we are trying to dissolve.  Helping people realize their worth is very powerful.  Giving them a voice is part of our goal.  As knowledgeable members of society we can advocate for ourselves and our children, serve on boards and committees, obtain employment in positions of power, and run for and be elected to political offices, all while serving  our community. Our collective voice will influence decisions and make positive changes for us.  By having Latinos serve on boards and represent the interests of our community, places of power, we can begin to deconstruct the institutionalized barriers that have inhibited our progress.  By empowering parents to advocate for their children, we will see positive changes in public education.  By empowering students to advocate for themselves we will see adults prepared to become active participants in this country.  ",

We will also be active in the recruitment process for a new Superintendent for Medford School District as well as continue to strengthen and grow parent groups at local schools.  Education is the key to our community's success and until we are given a level playing field on which to compete, we will continue to under achieve. In our region when parents speak up things begin to change.  We will educate parents on the importance of their active participation in their children's education and how that can directly affect their outcomes and academic progress.. We have been working to pass Comprehensive Immigration reform for 10 years.  This has presented its challenges, but with the current congressional atmosphere it looks like this may be our best chance to move something through.  We have already had several actions here locally and are going to continue the pressure until we see fair immigration reform.   \r\nAssessment will be determined by participation in educational forums and through meaningful change of district, state and national level policies that affect Latinos and immigrants.  As a large part of our work is done in the public education realm, it is difficult to obtain educational records, therefore our assessments are based on one-to one conversations with participants and their opinions of program successfulness.  Participants are surveyed and programs are developed or modified according to the responses.    ",

We are the lead organization for Una Voz Latino Coalition,  the Farm Worker Task Force, and work very closely with statewide coalitions like the Salem Keizer Coalition for Equality, PCUN,  Rogue Valley Oregon Action and CAUSA.    These coalitions help move our agenda forward, while developing a strong community base. The collaborations  integrate non traditional partners in our base. They increase our ability to leverage power and access new bases of support.  Una Voz has established itself as a voice in education for the community.  The Farm Worker Task Force takes a multidisciplinary approach to protecting farm worker family's rights during the local harvest.

    "narrative6": " Our strategy to dismantle inequality, oppression and discrimination is through education.  Education is the basis for success. Education will give us the tools to make decisions and succeed.  We have been affected by colonialism for hundreds of years; subjected to the decisions that others made for us.  It is time for us to decide.  We need to have the tools to make strategic decisions that will benefit our community and let us take back our power.  Oppression has been such an integral part of our lives that fear of change has consumed many of us.  The political and economic situations in Latin America have forced immigration to this country as a means of survival.  War, poverty and death have been very real in the lives of many of our members.  By giving people the tools to succeed, opportunities to progress, knowledge of systems and how to navigate through them, we build a stronger community capable of active participation in the decision making process.  This is the most effective way for us to dismantle oppression in our community.   Programs and actions are driven from community input.  Staff reviews the input and addresses the board with their recommendations.  The Board them implements programs or services that align with our mission and addresses the need in the community. Evaluation of the programs is done in the same manner.  Those most affected by the program or services give input to the programs' success or failure and modifications are made accordingly.   No more fear\u2026 only progress.  For us, by us.  ",

    "cycle_question": "We are using the current momentum to strengthen our base and strengthen relationships with other community individual and organizations.  Our organization has taken a position in support of Comprehensive Immigration Reform that keeps, families together, offers a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented and demilitarizes the US/Mexico border.  We are however, very concerned about the heavy use of deterrents, (wall, drones, etc) which we believe will only lead to more deaths on the border.   These areas along with temporary worker visas could undermine any real reform package.  IN the past we have seen Guest Worker proposals that gut workers rights and promote worker abuse my contractors.  As at least 50% of our constituency/supporters are not registered voters, we need to depend on other groups (eligible voters) to send a strong message that CIR is long overdue.  We have already had joint actions with other organizations and during the month of September, after the congressional recess, we  will be stepping up the pressure here locally.  Our local representative has a powerful role in leading Republican members of the house to call for a vote for CIR.  We are working closely with the local Democratic party to do voter registration in our community.  For this effort to be successful we need to reach out to all areas of the community, faith communities, other progressives, etc to get CIR passed.  We have been successful in engaging other non traditional groups is supporting CIR and are going to draw on those experiences to push our movement forward.  It has been a dream of Unete to see CIR pass for over 10 years.  We see a lot of suffering, depression and even deaths related to people's immigration status.  Worker abuse, domestic abuse,  racial profiling, poor graduation rates...all things that negatively affect our community wellness as a whole.  Its time for a change.  ",

    "narrative1": "The Wyoming Association of Churches (WAC) began in 1976 to replace the Wyoming Council of Churches formed in the 1960's that became defunct.  WAC's mission is to engage churches to promote spiritual living, stewardship of the land and social justice in Wyoming.  WAC's board is appointed by the judicatories of mainstream denominations with congregations in Wyoming.  A couple of decades ago, all funding for WAC came from the judicatories, but now that funding is less than 40% of the budget, because judicatories give less while costs increased. WAC has a part-time executive director and an assistant at 10 hours per week.\r\nWith limited resources, WAC accomplishes much through three volunteer teams: Spiritual Life, Sacred Ground and Peace & Justice. The Spiritual Life Team has promoted leadership development through retreats and promoted acceptance of diversity and respectful conversations on politically divisive issues through public forums.  The Sacred Ground Team has spoken out on stewardship of natural resources, mitigating climate change and protecting ecosystems to preserve biological diversity, including leading a growing campaign to protect Wyoming's Red Desert. \r\nThe Peace & Justice Team has focused primarily on advocacy.  WAC stopped a clone bill in Wyoming to Arizona's anti-immigrant bill in 2011.  In 2012, WAC stopped a bill to require drug testing for welfare recipients and got funding for a nursery for mothers in prison that the governor opposed.  In 2013, WAC got a trafficking bill passed with only one vote in opposition.  WAC has historically been recognized for speaking out for the poor and victims.\r\nThe executive director this summer moved from Laramie to Riverton to better implement a priority to build a relationship with the Wind River Reservation so that the churches can better stand with them in addressing issues of poverty, lack of power and discrimination.

    "narrative5": "The Wyoming Association of Churches (WAC) is a member of the Equality State Policy Center (ESPC). The ESPC is a coalition of several progressive organizations including labor and environmental groups that speaks out on timely issues relating to good government, tax policies, worker safety and other selected over-lapping issues to protect Wyoming's citizens.  WAC actively participates. (I am the Treasurer of the Board.) Also, one of WAC's board members participates.  She is Rev. Dee Lundberg. By working together we make a huge impact at the Wyoming State Legislature.  Also, we share knowledge.  In November,  when WAC was contacted that immigrants in Gillette who wanted help on worker safety, I contacted the ESPC and we co-sponsored a well-attended educational workshop in Gillette along with local churches.  The ESPC did a follow-up workshop in June and plans one for September. The goal of the ESPC is to build a progressive movement in Wyoming. We will be working with the ESPC in the implementation of this grant should it be funded.\r\nAlso, WAC is serving on the Wind River Reservation Health Disparities Committee that is a coalition that is examining gaps in health care services for Native Americans and how to close those gaps.  This began as a result of WAC serving on the advisory committee for the Wyoming Office of Multicultural Health that helped to launch this group.  There my role is primarily to listen at this stage and to network to provide information they may not have. This also helps WAC to connect with Native Americans, build relationships and to learn about their concerns.  One goal of this collaboration is for WAC to be able to better stand with the Wind River Reservation for social change and to connect them with other resources. ", 
    "narrative6": "I will start with background about myself, the executive director, to answer this question as to show capacity for implementation.  After college in the 1960's, I was a community organizer in the inner city of Cincinnati, Ohio and was involved with the Civil Rights Movement. I had been to the March on Washington in 1963. Besides Martin Luther King, Jr., a mentor of mine was Saul Alinsky for community organizing, even though he did not believe women could be good organizers.  I went to night law school and continued to be involved in nonprofit work. I moved to Wyoming 26 years ago, and served for a time on the board of Western States Center.  I grew up in a small town in rural SE Ohio where the Underground Railroad went through and was about half descendants of slaves and half white, so I am comfortable around people of color.  I was the first director of the Equality State Policy Center and was laid off because of lack of funding.  I am now in my dream job where I can combine my skills, passion and faith.  I became executive director in March 2011.  I was hired because of my background.  I had been involved with WAC since 1989. \r\nThe Wyoming Association of Churches has advocated on these issues since its beginning.  WAC was there to promote hate crimes legislation before Matthew Shepherd was brutally murdered because he was gay. WAC did a counter \"angel wings\" demonstration at Shepherd's funeral against the Kansas anti-gay protestors.  WAC promoted MLK Day. WAC led the effort to defeat the Arizona anti-immigration clone bill in the Wyoming legislature. WAC testified for the bill this year to end discrimination because of sexual orientation and gender identity. WAC has supported legislation to help the tribes on sovereignty issues and helped Native American youth with scholarships to attend the Western States Center CSTI training. WAC supported the ESPC's get-out-the-vote on the Wind River Reservation. I have moved to Riverton to work more closely with the WRR and to work toward engaging churches to address the racism toward Native Americans in Wyoming by whites.  The poverty on the WRR reminds me of the poverty where I grew up in SE Ohio.  Native Americans are poor because they are oppressed.  WAC can assist by addressing the racism of whites and homophobia of straight people and stand by the oppressed and marginalized on issues that will empower them.

    "cycle_question": "The Wyoming Association of Churches' current resolution on immigration is to, \"Promote immigration reform that shows compassion, does not break up families and allows an accessible path to citizenship.\"  In 2005, WAC co-sponsored a \"Wyoming Immigrant Access Forum.\"  In January 2011, WAC sponsored an all day workshop on \"A Faith Response to Immigration, it begins with ...\" Presenters were Amy Mendez, Denver Presbytery; Jen Smyers, Church World Services; State Senator Floyd Esquibel; Carmina Oaks, a native of Mexico City and founder of the Jackson Hole Latino Resource Center and artist Stevon Lucero. People came to Cheyenne from all over Wyoming, rare in January.  This was right before the Wyoming State Legislature began.  This helped us to organize an over-packed room to testify against the Arizona clone anti-discrimination bill. Only one testified for the bill.  No one on the legislature's committee even moved the bill, so it died - the best possible victory. WAC co-sponsored a regional pro-immigrant conference along with law enforcement and business in Salt Lake in October 2011 with a representative pastor from WAC speaking. I went to DC for a Bibles, Badges and Business coalition gathering and lobby day on the Hill in December 2012 and met with Wyoming's congregational delegation individually. \r\n\r\nWAC stays connected with that group and an evangelical organization promoting comprehensive reform.  WAC has distributed prayer cards with 40 scripture verses on welcoming strangers to churches. WAC had 20 people of faith gather in Cheyenne in June to help advocate for the federal reform.  A letter to the editor from WAC promoting immigration reform was published last month in the Casper Star Tribune.  Our Wyoming U.S. Congressional delegation has not been very receptive, but WAC has not given up. WAC agrees that the current national momentum sounds hopeful and wants Wyoming churches to be ready to be supportive.\r\nThe project proposed in this grant application would enable WAC to not just be an advocate, while that is very worthwhile, but to go beyond that and be a demonstration project for how immigrants can be organized for self-advocacy and how churches can be engaged to support them.  The Equality State Policy Center was doing organizing of immigrants in Rock Springs, Torrington and Rawlins, and was hoping to do organizing in Gillette, but the ESPC had to lay off its organizer and has not been able to continue that work due to lack of funding.  WAC helped with that effort to the extent that our limited resources allowed.  Hopefully at least two of those groups will continue and hopefully through the ESPC, WAC can link the group leaders together to become a stronger voice in Wyoming.  A main reason that Wyoming's Congressional delegation is being unresponsive to immigration reform is that the Latino population in Wyoming, while growing in numbers, is still small and lacks a strong, coherent voice.  As a result, no matter what the churches say or do, we are viewed as just \"do-gooders.\"  That needs to change.  This project could help do that. \r\n",

We were instrumental in passing a farmwork right -to -know bill in 1987 with local farmworkers and statewide support.   As Oregon Fair Share we always been working in statewide coalitions for immigrant rights.     Oregon Action has taken a position of clear support for CIR in Congress including support for the S 744 Bi-partisan bill.   \r\nCurrently in southern Oregon we are building momentum in strengthening Rogue Valley Oregon Action's immigration rights work with a growing community campaign to focus on Congressman Greg Walden's  power in  Congress to get a vote on CIR bill that includes a pathway to citizenship.    RVOA is working with a statewide coalition of CAUSA, PCUN and many other groups.  The goal is to magnify and focus power of the expanding Latino populations in rural Oregon combined with ally support of labor, faith and community allies.   RVOA has done many \"Where's Walden\" actions in Medford over the past few years.  Combining with other statewide groups that are on the ground in the 2nd District  the RVOA Immigration Empowerment Project will add a strong southern Oregon component to the broad 2nd District and statewide effort.   RVOA has been a founder of the  Rogue Valley Interfaith Immigration Coalition which is bringing faith power into local actions.   RVOA will focus on developing a Latino/ immigration rights leadership base of at least 50 and provide training and experience for 15 emerging activists within the Latino community.    Potential leaders will include students from Rogue Community College, Southern Oregon  University, families, out of work youth, and those with barriers to employment and civic engagement.   Key to building the Latino leadership base is the experience of our lead staff for the project: Virginia Camberos, a first generation immigrant whose outreach skills and organizing experience within the local Latino community  is vital.   Virginia has been doing outreach for Oregon's Healthy Kids for several years and working as outreach coordinator with Oregon Action.\r\nIn addition RVOA is organizing to insure that the excitement and actions in the CIR campaign is a building into an on-going social justice work in southern Oregon within RVOA.    Connecting the base building and leadership opportunities in the CIR campaign with the Oregon Action work on health care reform and health equity together with local campaigns on youth jobs, Ban the Box criminal justice issues will  result in a RVOA immigration leadership team that empowers local Latino community on Oregon Action's and allied work for racial  and economic justice.\r\n `",

Eco-feminism proposes that the struggle for women\u2019s rights should not be separated from the struggle for reparations to ecosystems that sustain life. The main argument is that all questions of domination are interconnected and that in order to understand how the oppression of women and the depredation of natural resources came about, we must look at the relationship between the various systems in which power is constructed. Eco-feminism unites culture and nature permitting women to value their identity by developing new ways of inclusion in our society, rescuing the value of their intellect and work and also respecting and preserving all manifestations of life.  \r\n\r\nWe believe that all individuals have the fundamental right to determine their own reproductive rights.  Furthermore, we boldly stand in support of women\u2019s reproductive health and abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, transgender rights and healthy sexual relationships. In developing projects with our emerging leaders, we have consistently come up against barriers of structural and institutional racism, deep-seated sexism and heteropatriarchy, homophobia, and structural poverty that we are actively working to dismantle.\r\n\r\nC2C stands with farmworkers and workers everywhere as we move towards a solidarity economy, where all workers are valued.\r\n\r\nOur current agricultural system is built on the backs of a low-wage, flexible labor force.  This food system is broken and the workers are bearing the brunt of the systemic chaos.    Currently, farmworkers in the US are some of the most vulnerable and exploited workers within our borders.  It is worth noting that the average life-span of an American farmworker is 49; compared to the average life-span of an American at 78 yrs. old.  \r\n\r\nWe cannot envision a just, healthy food system and community without taking into account the exploitation of workers (throughout the food system) and the poisoning of the earth.  Food sovereignty is looking at the \"root\" of what poisons our food system and not resting until our food system embodies justice and dignity.  C2C supports appeal of farmworkers, that their dignity should be made whole through fair trade wages along with common decency and respectful treatment at their workplace and homes at the hands of company representatives.\r\n\r\n",

    "narrative4": "In the past years, C2C has built the capacity of our volunteers and incorporated their talents and loving labor into our projects including Cocinas Sanas, Raices Culturales, Formaci\u00f3n C\u00edvica, and Cooperative Development .  Throughout C2C's programming, three core elements of social justice are emphasized: food sovereignty, movement building and participatory democracy. While programs and projects are often aimed at cultivating and practicing one of these principles, all of our programs seek to develop leadership within a broader framework that affirms the importance of all three elements for sustainable and transformative social change. Our projects are developed on this vision of change, which we believe occurs from the strategic intersection of all three program areas. \r\n\r\nC2C is prioritizing an alternative model of business for farmworker justice; Domestic Fair Trade(DFT).  C2C has been part of the Agricultural Justice Project(AJP) since 1999  and has worked to develop DFT standards for farmworkers in U.S.-based family and medium sized farms.  C2C is a recognized worker organization certified to conduct workplace audits and mediate conflicts between farmers and workers.  This third-party community based role is key to ensuring justice in the fields for farmworkers in a DFT workplace that has implemented the standards and is using the AJP Fair Trade label in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nEach Project has built-in accountability measures through the Americorps Volunteers Program, the Campaign to End Racial Profiling Program, and C2C membership.  We measure the success of programs through these accountability measures specific to each program.  Additionally, C2C\u2019s continued leadership within regional and national structures such as the U.S. Food Sovereignty Alliance, the Domestic Fair Trade Association, the Agricultural Justice Project, will demonstrate how we have met our internal goals for Food Sovereignty and grassroots Movement Building.  \r\n", 
    "narrative5": "C2C has worked closely with the Latino Civic Alliance for the past three years.  Latino Civic Alliance works to empower low-income Latinos through advocacy and civic engagement in Washington state.  Latino Civic Alliance has been key in organizing the annual Latino Legislative Day in March.  Each year they have rented a bus to take farmworkers to Olympia from Whatcom and Skagit County; to advocate for policy that supports the farmworker, immigrant community.  C2C is one of the main organizations organizing farmworkers and farmworker concerns at the policy level in Washington state.  The grassroots policy analysis from the farmworker community intersects other policy concerns for the Latino and immigrant community.\r\n\r\nThrough the work of Latino Civic Alliance, C2C has been given the opportunity to educate and work with people of color legislative champions, such as WA State Rep. Luis Moscoso and WA State Rep. Bob Hasegawa.\r\n\r\nThe Dignity Campaign is a network of organizations and individuals who affirm the need for an immigration reform bill based on human and labor rights. This bill would include legalization of the undocumented immediately, de-criminalization of immigration status and work, equal rights, reunification of families, an end to temporary and guest worker programs, and an end to free trade and the policies that cause the dislocation of people.  The coalition is currently endorsed by over 50 national organizations and groups, including our Whatcom allies, Bellingham Unitarian Fellowship and the Whatcom Democrats,\r\n\r\nThe Dignity Campaign represents what immigrant families believe they need in comprehensive immigration reform.  C2C, with the leadership of Maru Mora Villalpando, has conducted 100's of Dignity dialogues on comprehensive immigration reform in Whatcom and Skagit County and across WA state.  We will continue to organize until we have legalization for all, basic labor standards and a fair and dignified path to citizenship. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "C2C focuses on human rights work in Whatcom County.  Our human rights work addresses food sovereignty, workplace rights, and women\u2019s rights; all under a broad human rights perspective focusing on leadership development from immigrant, farmworker, and marginalized Latino families.  C2C is led by women of color who have lived the reality that U.S. history reveals; that people of color, women, and poor and low income communities have been excluded from equitable access to nutritious food, fair wages, and civic participation. Acting on their knowledge and experience, C2C is committed to systemic change that is multi-faceted and complex enough to address the depth of oppression and abuse our community faces.  C2C is the only people of color led organization in Whatcom and Skagit County.  In developing projects with our emerging leaders, we have consistently come up against barriers of structural and institutional racism, deep-seated sexism and heteropatriarchy, homophobia, and structural poverty that we are actively working to dismantle.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2012 C2C launched the Campaign to End Racial Profiling in Whatcom County, to take on the work of addressing race and oppression in the Latino farmworker community.  On May 5th 2013, we held the first ever Farm Worker March for Dignity, a historic 17-mile march from the rural area of Whatcom County into downtown Bellingham.  By the end of the march, we were a group of over 300 community members, half of whom are farmworkers from Whatcom County.  The March for Dignity represents the growing grassroots power that is being built with the farmworker community and being led by farmworker women, supported by local, state, regional, and national allies.  Our strengths are most visible in our leadership development and empowerment of farmworker women and youth.  This work is done through Cocinas Sanas (Healthy Kitchens) and Raices Culturales Youth Program.  In the last 6 months, Raices Culturales youth participation in Bellingham has grown to 25 young people who regularly participate in weekly youth programs, and another 12 young women and men who actively seek out our Healthy Kitchens and Support Group.  At each program, we emphasize the power-building effects of community organizing to end all forms of oppression.  And we are continuing with our commitment to incorporate radical and creative play in our youth and children programming to break through rigid gender binary norms and patriarchy.\r\n\r\nWe create culturally appropriate community spaces that nurture dissenting activities and opinions against heteronormative patriarchy.  Our explicit grounding in eco-feminism is a firm base from which we approach our work to end oppression of, and within, the farmworker communities in Washington. At this time, C2C is a rare alternative place to hear and practice dissenting action against entrenched racism, sexism, and homophobia in rural Washington.",

    "cycle_question": "C2C endorses the Dignity Campaign as an alternative to the current immigration reform bill.  We have taken a strong position opposing the current senate bill, S744.  C2C was one of the first organizations to publicly oppose the bill based on the punitive enforcement and border protective measures and the expansion of the guest-worker program.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are approximately 3 million farmworkers in the United States.  Of that number, 70% of those workers are undocumented.  This statistic holds true in our membership community.  Through the organizing work of C2C and the Dignity Campaign, we have been engaging farmworker leaders (documented and undocumented) at the policy level to fight for real immigration reform based on the Dignity Campaign platform that has been crafted by those who are most affected by immigration policy.  We need real solutions to the denial of migrants\u2019 rights, to the corporate economic and political system that forces migration, and to the economic crisis that affects working people in general. \r\n\r\nStarting on July 11, 2013 over 200 farmworkers walked out of the fields and began a work stoppage and eventually a strike to demand better wages and working conditions.  Our organization was called by the workers and asked for leadership and support in a desperate attempt for justice.  Over the past 6 weeks, an elected group of farm worker leaders (Familias Unidas por la Justicia/Families United for Justice) have been in negotiations with Sakuma Bros. Farms, Inc., a large berry farm in Skagit County.  Throughout this struggle, C2C Executive Director, Rosalinda Guillen and farmworker organizer, Angelica Villa have been supporting the farmworker leaders and have been integral in negotiations between workers and management.  The grassroots leadership of this committee has been outstanding as they are up against a large corporate farm that depends on low-wage workers.  It is important to note that most of the workers and their families are indigenous Mixteco and Triqui workers from Oaxaca, Mexico and migrate every year from Northern California to work the berry season.  At this date, the Familias Unidas por la Justicia (representing over 250 workers) has authorized a boycott on all Sakuma Bros. Farms products.  Actions have been happening in Whatcom, Skagit, King and Yakima County.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are approximately 75 guestworkers from Mexico working Sakuma Bros. Farms, through the federal H-2A (Bracero) program.  This is the first time guestworkers have been brought into these counties since the 1940\u2019s.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to continue to develop leadership in the farmworker community, monitor and analyze the current events through the end of November, educate the solidarity community and develop a report on how the guestworker program plays out in our local region.  This report will inform the current immigration bill that seeks to expand the guestworker  program.  Our work after the harvest season will be focused on preparing the farmworker leadership for the coming season and working on state legislation addressing farmworker issues - which will be determined by the grassroots leaders and the ongoing campaign at Sakuma Berry Farms.",

    "narrative3": "WDAC has worked for over 5 years to empower immigrants and other disenfranchised folks to stand for social justice. We have untokenized our communities from the non-profit industrial complex and have empowered members to take on challenges to not only share their stories but take leadership and organize the community on oppression liberation. The biggest concerns that we have addressed have been the communities' fear of standing up for their rights, others falling into a comfort zone of not feeling like doing anything and also the lack of information of resources and support available for us. Within Washington state immigrant communities in rural areas continue to have a constant fear towards the system due to the lack of knowledge of their rights. This big issue is visible in agricultural areas. Another issue has become the tendency of another part of our communities falling into comfort zones due to the fact that Washington state has provided undocumented communities the opportunity to obtain a driver license and also in state tuition, some folks feel that they should not ask for more, and should not raise their voices due to the fear of being stripped from those privileges. Finally, the fact that many of our resources and information available to help immigrant communities has for one reason or another not become accessible.\r\n\r\nWe as the WDAC empower members by various forms, we lead by example causing empowerment within members to take action. We share leadership opportunities and also prep members to the tasks that need to be taken to step up to leadership. We keep a constant communication with out members to effectively understand the fields sentiments with policies that are oppressing our communities as well as listening to ideas, and feed back on strategies. We are intentional of giving that sense of ownership to our communities on the work that we have accomplish cumulatively. \r\n\r\nThis work will not only lead to tangible results with campaigns that we make take up, it will lead to a rising of a whole community physically, mentally and emotionally. We are in this to empower communities to take on the challenge of leadership by acting on changes the wish to see. \r\n\r\nOur problem has been the need to work in low wage jobs to pay for college and help our families, while still maintaining the momentum of our movement for justice.  While we do not want to be controlled by the agenda of traditional funders, we recognize the need to find progressive sources of funds to sustain WDAC.  A grant from SJF will allow WDAC leadershp to make this justice work our part time jobs and stay focused on our work.  \r\n\r\n",

We will do that by empowering affiliates as well as providing communities the educational knowledge to build up their own chapters in efforts to continue having an ongoing empowerment of the community coming from within the community. Our goal is to have 10 Regional Coordinators in various regions of Washington State, emphasizing intentional targeting in rural areas. \r\n At the state level, we have also set our goals to pass the Washington State DREAM Act while also creating a strong presence in the Olympia by establishing a working relation with elected officials. At the national level, we will get some relief for the 11 million undocumented members, whether its an immigration reform or a presidential discretionary action.\r\n\r\nIN THE PAST, THE ALL-VOLUNTEER OPERATION WITH VERY LIMITED RESOURCES HAS HAMPERED STEADY PROGRESS ON OUR WORK.  IN 2014, WE WANT TO DEVELOP A BASIC LEVEL OF SUSTAINABILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD DURING THIS CRITICAL TIME IN IMMIGRATION JUSTICE HISTORY. Our goal this year will be to move from 18 active members in the organizations to 50 by the end of the year. We currently have 350 members on our list serve and our goal is to obtain 1000 members to our list serve where we will share resources available provided by our community partnerships. ", 
    "narrative5": "The Washington DREAM Act Coalition will continue to partner and collaborate with both state and national organizations in our efforts to work on comprehensive immigration reform. At the state level, we sit in in the Washington Immigration Roundtable where we have joined over 20 different organizations from the state of Washington where organizations such as SEIU, OneAmerica, El Centro de La Raza, 21 Progress, NWIRP, Washington CAN and many more sit in. We as a collaborative group discuss tactics on and approaches we can take as Washington State in efforts to push the national agenda forward towards immigration reform. As the WDAC we are the only immigrant youth led organization representing at first hand the impact of the policies and issues towards our communities. Our organization is one of the few that has a field and is the only one that is membership lead. We also have never had ties to political parties or government money which means that we have a more liberal approach towards are tactics without having any problems.  \r\n\r\nOur second group is the United We DREAM network. This Network consists of over 60 affiliate  immigrant youth led organization in over 25 different states in the country. The UWD is the largest immigrant organization in the nation which is lead also by membership. We are part of the weekly field calls where we discuss tactics and days of action in effort to have a bigger national impact. We constantly go to Washington D.C. in efforts to push humane policy forward with out network as group. Every year we take part of Congress which is where all the affiliate organizations meet and decided the next years goals. ", 
    "narrative6": "The Washington DREAM Act Coalition is mainly led by immigrants and allies from communities of color. We strongly believe in intersectionality when we are talking about the issues that we are fighting for, which is why a strong emphasis on our organizing is on the UndocuQueer movement. We believe in the liberation of all forms of oppression for immigrant communities, especially Dreamers and DACAmented individuals, whether these forms of oppression are ableism, ageism, sexism, racism, homophobia, and so on.\r\n \r\nSome examples of how we have worked on racial justice and other forms of oppression within immigrant communities are to ensure that the leadership is as inclusive as possible so that each community may have their voices heard, made sure that the issues we are working on feature intersectionality (for example, WDAC Partnership Coordinator Monica Mendoza-Castrejon is part of the Women's Coalition with OneAmerica and ensures that conversations are also had in WDAC to ensure that women's equality is a part of immigration reform as a whole), and because our organization is mainly led by People of Color, youth, and those who are struggling to get by economically, we are supportive of any efforts to include racial equality and equality in general in our immigrant rights efforts.\r\n \r\nOur plans to work on liberation of oppression is mostly going to be through the artivism work, apart from the work we are already doing in regards to advocacy. One goal is to create a billboard and/or highly visible mural that will feature the message of immigrant rights with Women/People of Color being the main focus. Other plans include weekly art collectives where members come together to do spoken word/create art and eventually create an archive in the form of a scrapbook and video, sending postcards to legislators with images that youth create, hosting workshops to other organizations and so forth. All of these goals will allow an outlet of expression for people who oftentimes feel that they cannot express their voice through legislative affairs. We will also be helping organize marches/rallies and be in support of groups that ensure that social justice is at the forefront.",

As a coalition we stand against the further criminalization and marginalization  of our communities. This current bill although will put on a path to citizenship to some of our more privilege communities, it will place in the shadows and in deportation the most vulnerable. We believe in a onward process based in the political reality and the urgency of our communities needs. Our community has gone through so much pain due to family separation, employer exploitation, ice and police brutality, and for that they are in need of some relief and protective rights. The Senate bill does establish those rights so for that we support it. We do how ever will pressure President Obama to expand the Deferred Action for all 11 million people if congress fails to act this year, or decided to come forward with a worst bill than already presented. We as an organization do not fall in political partisan lines. We have understand that both parties have fail our communities and for what we hold both Democrats and Republicans accountable. This has also been an issue presented at the state level. Issues such as secure communities continues to criminalize our communities.",

As a result our populations, specially Latino, are being reported to increase and suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer. Paradoxically Latinos used to be reported as the most healthier groups when they arrive in the US (Migration Policy Institute).\r\n\r\nAmong many, few of the root causes of these issues are: \r\n-immigrants and refugees are the most oppressed populations through discrimination against, who are not English fluent (or do not speak any), the dominant language. As a consequence we are the ones who suffer high levels of stress, known as toxic stress, that lead to states of constant illnesses ending up in chronic fatigue and diseases. \r\n-the US Immigration System is one of the worse worldwide because punishes people despite of being great hard workers and family supporters, to be deported not just because of lack of documentation but also, minor mistakes that are never pardoned. \r\n-left to jobs that require to work under bad whether and unsafe conditions. For instance,  tasks that requires contact with insulation - one of the most dangerous and proven to create respiratory health issues.\r\n-Poverty and Housing ending up on health  problems as well: Latinas/os get paid at the lower wages of the market. When a person, specially undocumented, try to complain they are left without a job, if not are harmed by employers, and or oppressed to not talked about their problems and racial injustice.\r\n\r\nWe build collective power by organizing and working:\r\na) with who leave in rural and urban areas of small cities or not at the metropolitan centers of Oregon, such as Hood River, Gresham, Corvallis, and Woodburn. Few used to be from Salem and Portland.\r\nb) to develop leaders, guiding and encouraging them to participate at Board, Advisory Boards, and Committees.\r\nc) creating opportunities for advocacy and practice by inviting legislators to participate and listen people at our community events, that at times are organized inside of the Capitol Building during the Legislative sessions.\r\n\r\nChange to these root causes will occur by bringing our community members to collective actions that exposes the government and policy makers to feel ashamed by their lack of humanity, until they propose Bills that include and respect everyone, who resides and work so hard to build Oregon and in the US economy and society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Among the many forms of social oppression racial and economic injustice might be worse because they produce power control over larger populations that need the jobs that are available, despite of low wages and inhuman conditions to be performed. Latinos/as as the majority undocumented population of the US is consequently among the most oppressed. \r\n \r\nBecause we are aware of power control over our communities through racial and economic injustice as a combination of racism and homophobia of \u201cold immigrants\u201d who are afraid to lose their status quo or \u201ctheir lands\u201d that, in fact, were conquered from First People (native Americans), since 2009 we have realized the importance of engaging and participating not only in the Immigration Reform movement but also in the Oregon Health Care Reform to assure that we would be able to access affordable health care and with better quality. \r\n\r\nWe then, started learning from Allies organizations, obtaining technical support from Oregon Health Action Campaign and Health Reform Allies. However, we also started engaging Allies in our community events so that they would learn from us, the immigrants, about our vision and believes of what is good for us. Also, CHARLA cohort of 2010-2011 brought 35 Latinas/os and Africans to work collectively to change the paradigma and politics of Brown-Black. \r\n\r\nOur programs and developmental activities are based on Popular Education and Pedagogy of the Oppressed social theory. Despite of controversial and adverse reactions by the public and even our partners, these techniques open space to everyone's participate which is a great improvement for whom have been social marginalized. Materials and translation in Spanish are provided to assure that everyone can understand the subjects and participate at collective decisions, as well as food and child care, so that Moms can fully participate. Besides, we work for and encourage collective fundraising so that other communities can participate in our programs.\r\n \r\nWe motivate our members to seek leadership positions and face the challenges to work with Allies. Besides, our leadership development programs are connected with actions, no matter of participants' formal education (e.g., a Spanish illiterate seasonal farm worker, at the final evaluation, after 10 months of CHARLA work, said: \u201cnow, I feel comfortable to eat with you all\".

It is truly a lack of humanity when one, despite of what she or he might have done, is required still to wait for 10 to 15 years to maybe receive a paper that acknowledges them as a citizen of this country. After all, we questioned ourselves: what is to be, really,  a Citizen?\r\n\r\nDespite of that, we acknowledge that among those 11 million, about 50% could benefit from the possibility to leave the shades and become a human being again. \r\n\r\nHowever, what we also realized is that, once more, the system proposed is not a Humanized one, in any ways, because several aspects, two of them are: 1) it is a highly punitive system, for those who, in fact, are suffering the consequences of a Global Gentrification and wars not caused and or provoked by them; and 2) once more, the system do not acknowledge or facilitates access to essential services such as preventive and health care that could stop the enhancement of chronic diseases among our populations. \r\n\r\nA Window of Opportunity: \r\nDespite of sadness, we have made a strategic decision to work, as harder it might require, to engage, organize, and prepare small groups of immigrants and refugees, specially Latinos/as, to learn the realms of this current Immigration Reform together with the proposal for Health Care reform for Universal Health Care, and find the holes they have, to advocate for needed and immediate changes. \r\nThis decision is moving us towards a new hope, that, collectively we can start changing situations of oppression that we have been leaving for so long. That, we the oppressed, have a unique opportunity to easy the guilt of the oppressors and support them to become humanized being.  \r\nAs a consequence, we are taking advantage and engaging everyone who might feel the desire and hope to grow together and accomplish this huge tasks by collective reflection and actions.",

This year, we effectively reached out to the business, agriculture, labor, LGBTQ, education, public health, civic and faith communities to help pass legislation that reinstated the right to drive for undocumented individuals. We were successful because we combined efforts, found common ground and were willing to compromise in order to advance our shared agendas and create meaningful change that would not have been possible individually.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will contribute to making real a resolution of one the root causes of oppression facing the immigrant and farmworker community:  lack of legal immigration status.  Immigrants and farmworkers who can attain status will have a measure of security that facilitates their participation in our organizing efforts to address the underlying power dynamics of these oppressive systems.

Our data base is antiquated and an upgrade would allow us to be more efficient.  \r\n \r\n\u2022\tDues change and cashless capacity: Anticipating mass group processing events at which we will conduct membership sign up (and collect dues), a change in our dues structure and cashless capacity is not only a need, but a requirement.  Presently PCUN\u2019s quarterly dues system has thirty different prices for payment, depending on the month, when dues expires, and whether a member is retired or permanently disabled.  We will simplify payments to two amounts, while maintaining overall equity and sustainability.  Without these changes, we would not be able to process new members on a larger scale.  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tAccreditation push: In order to legally provide immigration services to our community, the Board of Immigration Appeals must first approve more staff as accredited individuals. Both Causa and PCUN\u2019s Centro de Servicios para Campesinos are already recognized agencies but we would like to build our capacity by increasing our number of accredited representatives. \r\n\r\n\u2022       Continued planning and tool building: Continue to plan and develop tools to be better prepared for our statewide implementation of legal services and community education.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAnti fraud campaign in the community: As immigration reform becomes a greater possibility, the risk of being taken advantage of by fraudulent \u201cnotaries\u201d increases. The campaign will provide educational materials that prevent our community from falling into the traps of individuals that make false promises to assist with immigration procedures and ultimately result in harming our communities.  \r\n\r\n\u2022      Statewide implementation of education and services: Once immigration reform passes, we will reach out to our communities across the state to provide information around eligibility and the processing of legal documentation.", 
    "narrative5": "PCUN and Causa have a leadership role in the Executive Committee of Fair Immigration Reform Movement, leading the struggle for comprehensive immigration reform.  Both PCUN and Causa represent the interests of the immigrant population in Oregon and help make national strategic decisions in the fight for a Comprehensive Immigration Reform. The team includes immigrants\u2019 rights coalitions from across the nation, which creates a national narrative around the need and urgency for Comprehensive Immigration Reform.  PCUN\u2019s outgoing Secretary-Treasurer, Larry Kleinman, is leading FIRM\u2019s work nationally to prepare for legalization implementation, a process that actively involves 20 organizations including Causa and PCUN.  \r\n\r\nIn 2008, PCUN, the United Farm Workers, Farmworker Justice, Farm Labor Organizing Committee, Oxfam and others co-initiated what today is known as the \u201cEquitable Food Initiative,\u201d working to fashion and market a \u201csustainability\u201d label for agricultural products which includes meaningful and effective standards for working conditions.  This Initiative has attracted major food industry partners and is completing its pilot phase.  Thousands of workers will develop and benefit from better working conditions in the coming years, thanks to EFI.\r\n",

Even as we strive to expand those opportunities and make them more impactful, we are mindful that we must focus more on the ideas conveyed.\r\n\r\nWorking to combat and transform what we call the \u201cisms\u201d (racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, etc.) has long figured at the center of our work and the CAPACES Leadership Institute will build substantially on this tradition.  For example, a prime focus of the \u201cCAPACES 101\u201d course, in which PCUN enrolls all new staff and aspiring movement leadership, is our articulation of the \u201cIsms\u201d, how they manifest in ourselves and our work, and how we discern the difference between personal \u201cprejudice\u201d and institutional discrimination. \r\n\r\nOne defining struggle for PCUN is our two-decade\u2019s old alliance with LGBTQ organizations.  PCUN first took an outspoken stance against anti-gay attacks in 1992, putting us at odds with the sentiments of most Latino community leaders and, frankly, the bulk of our membership and community base.  Our efforts to be (and be known as) a safe space for LGBTQ folks and to re-frame the debate as one about equality (rather than \u201cmorality\u201d) has been impactful, though there\u2019s clearly much work remaining, both within PCUN and the community.  One recent new opportunity involves a new weekly radio show called La Voz de Todos, produced by \u201cout\u201d Latinos/as and which explicitly addresses LGBTQ issues.\r\n",

The vote represented potential relief for over 11 million undocumented immigrants but at the same time included horrific provisions that will militarize our southern border to the point of resembling a war zone. \r\n\r\nAlthough we were repulsed by and dissatisfied with major components of the bill, both PCUN and Causa, as organizations, urged Congress to continue to move forward with the legislative process. We did so because the bill, at its core, opens the path to keep millions of families together and provide relief from deportation. We understand that the passage of immigration reform will not be the end of the immigrant rights struggle. We will have to use this victory and build on it in the long term to combat the negative provisions that come with this legislation. \r\n\r\nThe momentum around immigration reform has allowed and obligated us to organize communities in which we had very little capacity before. That has resulted in increased capacity and participation from community members throughout the state that we have not before had the ability to engage with our work. We will use these new relationships and connections to help with the implementation phase as well. \r\n\r\n",

OneAmerica\u2019s members have focused their attention on material support for the workers, and on demonstrating that there are local workers ready to fill Sakuma\u2019s workforce needs.  Successfully making this point will mean that Sakuma will not have a valid case for bringing guest workers in to fill jobs on the farm. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tOneAmerica members in Yakima organized around the State\u2019s recent redistricting process.  Members turned out to give testimony at 16 of 18 Redistricting Commission hearings statewide.  This grassroots advocacy was a significant factor in the creation of both Washington State\u2019s first majority-minority Congressional district in King County and the Latino-majority 15th State Legislative District in Yakima County.\r\n\r\nOneAmerica was founded immediately after September 11, 2001 to address the backlash against immigrant communities and communities of color.  Though our work began as a response to discrimination against Arabs, Muslims and South Asians, we soon learned that all immigrant communities need to actively train leaders to be powerful advocates. OneAmerica is now the largest immigrant advocacy organization in the state, with more than 2,500 immigrant, refugee, and allied members.  ",

Washington was home to 909,312 immigrants in 2011, which is more than the total population of Jacksonville, Florida.\u201d\r\n\r\nOneAmerica organizes immigrants and refugees, regardless of their legal status, both directly and through institutional alliances and partnerships.  We build collective power by creating as many opportunities as possible for immigrants and refugees to act on their own behalf to change the institutions and policies that impact their families and communities.  We build and support broad and diverse coalitions to advance the priorities identified by our members and constituencies.\r\n\r\nOneAmerica\u2019s vision is a peaceful world where every person\u2019s human rights and dignity are respected, where communities appreciate differences and stand together for justice and equality and where each contributes to the common good.  Our work is grounded in our values: justice, courage, respect, collaboration and accountability.\r\n\r\nWe identify primarily as a multi-ethnic organizing and advocacy organization grounded in its relationships with diverse communities and constituencies.   \r\n\r\nOur nation and the state of Washington are changing.  As Washington\u2019s largest immigrant advocacy organization, OneAmerica is uniquely positioned to empower Washington State and the nation to harness the potential of its growing diversity so that all communities will grow more prosperous and equitable in this complex and changing economy and world. By building the political power of immigrant communities, OneAmerica is poised to ensure that immigrant communities and communities of color will help to shape our shared future.\r\n",

We will identify, recruit, train and retain volunteer members, and develop their capacity as community leaders.  As a OneAmerica Base Group, this group will engage in OneAmerica\u2019s efforts to advance the principles of democracy and build power in immigrant communities across the state of Washington.  \r\n\r\nWe will begin to build the Spokane Base Group through our proven community organizing model. There are several key issues of concern to immigrant communities which we believe are particularly relevant in Spokane and surrounding areas; these will serve as starting points for conversation, education and action with our growing base group:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tComprehensive immigration reform\r\nThis year is a pivotal one for immigration policy at the national level, with Congress considering major changes to the U.S. immigration system, which have the potential to affect the lives of many immigrants living in the State of Washington.  OneAmerica will engage immigrant community members in Spokane in education, discussion, and conversations with public stakeholders around immigrant community interests and concerns as related to these changes.  In the event that a comprehensive immigration reform bill is passed by Congress, OneAmerica\u2019s Base Community will play a key role in capitalizing on opportunities for immigrant communities to have a voice in the implementation of the changes.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tBuilding connections among diverse communities\r\nSpokane Base Group members, in partnership with OneAmerica, will build partnerships among immigrant and non-immigrant constituencies in support of racial equity and issues of common concern to immigrant communities.  These efforts will expand on our work to date in Spokane building partnerships among faith communities, immigrant communities and business leaders in Spokane and Eastern Washington.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "OneAmerica is currently participating in the Western States Center Uniting Communities Cohort, an innovative project to help community-based organizations that are committed to racial justice, tribal sovereignty, and immigrant & refugee rights to elevate, integrate and advance LGBTQ justice.  We chose to join the Uniting Communities Cohort to build on the momentum created by our participation in 2012\u2019s successful marriage equality campaign in Washington. We recognize that in order to further integrate LGBTQ issues in our ongoing work, we need targeted training as well as a chance to develop our practices in a collaborative environment with nonprofit peers. OneAmerica\u2019s work is rooted in the experiences, concerns, and ideas of our members. The fact that our membership has requested more information on LGBTQ issues is very important to us, and in response, we are developing our board, staff and membership\u2019s ability to be leaders on intersecting LGBTQ and immigration issues.\r\n\r\nOneAmerica also has a strong history of collaboration with allies in the organized labor movement.  Our mutual commitment to building collective power, organizing, and advancing the rights of immigrant workers means that we have found strong allies in the members and leaders of local SEIU, UFCW, and other union groups.  Over the past several years these partnerships have manifested in collaborative campaigns, trainings, rallies and actions on behalf of airport workers, fast food workers, and comprehensive immigration reform.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "Immigrants and refugees \u2013 their experiences, voices, stories, values, needs, and priorities for social change \u2013 drive OneAmerica\u2019s work.  This intentional building of power and leadership within historically marginalized immigrant communities of all ethnicities reflects the organization\u2019s consistent commitment to addressing intersecting oppressions and promoting racial justice.  \r\n\r\nThese are recent examples of our work on issues of intersecting oppression, which push toward racial justice and ending all forms of discrimination:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn partnership with Women\u2019s Funding Alliance, we are working to fight sexism and lift up immigrant women by incorporating a gender analysis into all programs, projects and campaigns going forward.  This includes leadership development work with the immigrant women leaders of many OneAmerica Base Groups, as well as clearly identifying, naming, and prioritizing the needs of immigrant women and girls in our 2014 policy advocacy agenda.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOur participation in the Western States Center Uniting Communities Cohort engages all levels of the organization \u2013 grassroots members, staff, and leadership \u2013 in the work to unite LGBT and immigrant rights movements.  Full inclusion of LGBT families in CIR is a priority for our immigration reform advocacy work this year.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOur immigrant members routinely support workers\u2019 rights through actions such as the Sakuma Farms strike, as well as organized campaigns in collaboration with labor allies for low wage workers, airport workers, and childcare workers.\r\n\r\nRacial justice has been a theme of OneAmerica\u2019s organizational values since the beginning.  Our earliest campaigns were designed to raise awareness and end the discrimination and profiling experienced by Arab, Muslim, and South Asian immigrant communities after 9/11, by engaging a broad spectrum of community members in conversation and action.\r\n",

    "cycle_question": "OneAmerica supports the passage of Comprehensive Immigration Reform legislation with a clear path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Immigrant communities in Spokane have already joined in strong support of this position by organizing community outreach and numerous events in partnership with OneAmerica, including one of the largest May Day rallies in Spokane\u2019s history.  Here in Washington State, we have the opportunity to bring up to 240,000 immigrants out of the shadows, and in the process begin to cultivate a generation of community leaders and voters.  \r\n\r\nOneAmerica has set the following objectives for a campaign for comprehensive immigration reform in Washington State:\r\n\r\n>>Advocate and educate diverse stakeholders \u2013 including those who are traditionally opposed - about immigrant communities\u2019 stories and experiences in the context of comprehensive immigration reform.\r\n\r\n>>Move our traditional allies to champion issues within the immigration debate that are of particular importance to immigrant workers and their families in Washington State.\r\n \r\nOneAmerica is in the midst of a campaign leveraging our membership, relationships in the business and faith communities, and our core capacities (policy, coalition-building, organizing, communications) to drive a multi-prong strategy to engage immigrant communities and demonstrate a clear need for comprehensive immigration reform.  These activities not only advance the possibility of a bill passing this year; they also build the skills and capacity of our base membership for the long run, including implementation of the bill, as well as continuing work on racial justice and immigrant integration.\r\n\r\n Organizing & Mobilizing / Leadership Development:  Many individual immigrants and/or their families are volunteering and receiving training to share compelling personal testimony on the impact of the broken immigration system across Washington State.  \r\n\r\n Coalition Building:  In addition to convening the Washington Immigration Roundtable (a statewide coalition of more than 40 organizations concerned with immigration reform), OneAmerica is also coordinating with diverse tables of labor unions, business leaders, faith leaders, children\u2019s and women\u2019s organizations, LGBT groups and environmental organizations.\r\n\r\nOur intention, with support from the Social Justice Fund, is specifically to build the capacity of Spokane\u2019s immigrant communities to continue the push for passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill, or equitable implementation of such a bill if passed this year.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "The Latino population in Multnomah County is booming -- growing more than 3-fold since 1990. Despite this growth, we continue to face educational and civic institutions that are under-equipped to meet the needs of the community, and a civic culture that has traditionally excluded the participation of immigrant, refugee and communities of color.\r\n\r\nAccording to Communities of Color in Multnomah County: An Unsettling Profile, there are  in Multhnomah County, approximately 150,000 Latinos who are marginalized, living in poverty, with barriers to family wage jobs, economic stability and higher education often due to their immigration status. Each year, the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Field Office detains between 3120 and 3900 immigrants, the majority of whom are Latinos and end up in deportation proceedings, tearing families apart and creating emotional trauma and increased financial burden on these families who are already struggling to survive.  This trauma coupled with not having the right to vote in elections that affect their lives perpetuates a sense of powerlessness affecting even those community members who can vote.  While nationally Latinos saw an increase in voter participation in 2008, Oregon Latino participation declined to its lowest in the last three election cycles. Only 39% of Hispanics reported having voted in the 2008 election.  Oregon lagged behind the national average of 49% Hispanic voter turnout. \r\n\r\nLatino Network asserts that we as a community can help reverse these trends through programming that facilitates the civic confidence and leadership among grassroots community members.  By doing so, we begin to navigate institutions that impact our community and engage in community organizing efforts to advocate for and create systems change. \r\n\r\nLatino Network\u2019s programs include Juntos Aprendemos an early literacy program for children 3-5 years old and their parents; Family and Youth Engagement, which builds connections between youth, families and schools; Conexiones Summer Academy that provides college and carrier exposure, leadership development and academy support, and the Community Healing Initiative that works to reduce the overrepresentation of Latino youth in the justice system through a culturally specific system of care; and lastly Leadership and Civic Engagement which engages traditionally disenfranchised Latino communities in civic and community development initiatives.  \r\n\r\nThrough our L\u00edderes Academy, Latino Network works to advance social justice culture and education by promoting civic literacy programs that engage Latino community members to participate in a rigorous curriculum rooted in community organizing, social justice and civic engagement. We work with each cohort to develop a framework of understanding of how we are impacted as individuals and as a community by systemic oppression and government structures. The group works to identify issues affecting the community for collective action through action-based projects and community organizing. \r\n",

Grassroots outreach will have two objectives: 1) to build awareness of the impact of organizing for collective action; and 2) secure 25 participants for the 2014 Cohort who can inform and impact the course of immigration reform policy. \r\n\r\nThe 2014 Cohort will author a storybook of families impacted by the current immigration system. Participants will capture stories outlining the realities of being undocumented in Oregon and the impact of deportation of family members. L\u00edderes Advisory Committee members will support as project leads to Cohort 2014.  Cohort members will share the documented stories and meet with elected officials and/or staff with the goals of highlighting the multi-layered impacts of the current immigration system on mixed immigration status families, imparting the complexity of our political strength, and securing commitment to support and advocate for an equitable immigration reform bill. \r\n\r\nLatino voter turnout in Multnomah County is lower than the national average. Thus, the project will include a Latino voter education component targeting individuals of potentially mix-status families in Multnomah County.  Voter education and action by all - regardless of status - increases pressure on elected officials to pass immigration reform.  Additionally, undocumented immigrants while not able to vote can educate voters, which in our experience strengthens their understanding of their own political power and agency. \r\n\r\nSkillset development, political analysis development and implementation of community organizing, and civic confidence will be measured through pre and post assessments.

Latino Network\u2019s Executive Director, Carmen Rubio serves as the Co-Chair of the Coalition. \r\n\r\nLatino Network is a member of the Diversity and Civic Leadership Program a capacity building program for underrepresented community-based organizations in order to increase constituent participation in the civic governance of the City.

    "narrative6": "As a culturally-specific organization serving Latinos, whom as a group are profoundly impacted by racial inequities, working towards racial justice is at the core of Latino Network\u2019s mission.  Latino Network\u2019s work springs from the core belief in Latino community self-determination\u2014that is, the ability of community members to participate meaningfully in the decisions that affect their lives and the lives of their families. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s this core belief that informs our programs and the design of projects like this one, which will allow us to amplify the voice of those most impacted by the current immigration system.  While we don\u2019t require participants to list their immigration status, a large number disclose their undocumented status or that of someone they know.  We know they are precisely the participants whose voices need to be heard and whom we will support to build their skillset to speak with elected officials and educate voters.  Their civic participation is critical to advance racial justice, and the emphasis to organize around immigration reform is directly interconnected to advancing economic justice because immigration status impacts employment and fair wages.  We are confident the Latino voter education component of this project will help bring people out of the shadows, feel empowered and motivated to influence present and future generations of voters, including their own children. \r\n\r\nAs part of L\u00edderes Academy curriculum we work to build awareness on the intersections of race, gender, sexuality,economic and environmental justice to build a stronger collective working toward social justice community.\r\n\r\nOrganizationally, we have participated in programs such as the Uniting Communities Program that supports organizations working in the racial justice and immigrant rights movements to proactively engage and include their members and constituencies who are LGBTQ people of color.  As a result, our organization updated internal policies that are affirming of the LGBTQ community, increased collaborations with organizations like Basic Rights Oregon, and increased our targeted outreach in the LGBTQ community.\r\n\r\nWhile we want our community to be leading on the issues that most impact us and play key roles in developing solutions, we know we must do this in coalition not only with other communities of color but also with our White allies.  For example, we play key role within Portland Public Schools where we not only serve as a bridge but also hold our White allies at the District accountable to our communities.  In developing relationships with allies we work to help them understand our experience as Latinos, and we align ourselves with leaders and supporters who understand the key concept of personal transformation as root of social change.   As a result, we have strong supporters of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds who have helped us move our community agenda forward. \r\n",

We hope that the majority of our community will benefit from the CIR bill that ultimately passes, but recognize that immigration issues will remain a concern for our community.  At the same time, other issues affecting the Latino community often straddle immigration status.  We have a long history of working on those issues and our project while pressing for immigration reform will also harness the engagement and energy of the current moment to address other critical issues for the Latino community.  \r\n\r\nLatino Network has a demonstrated commitment of supporting the people most impacted by social injustices to organize and speak for themselves.  Immigration reform impacts our entire constituency either directly or because they know someone who is impacted directly by the current immigration system.  The current momentum around immigration reform brings with it some hope as well as caution.  As an organization, we will continue to conduct critical analysis of immigration policy and engage in advocacy activities alongside immigrant communities.  As part of this movement we want to ensure that our Latino community is informed, engaged and prepared with the necessary tools to organize, collaborate with other impacted communities, advocate and influence an equitable immigration reform bill.  \r\n",

    "narrative3": "While there are many excellent program that work with you in Oregon, there is insufficient youth-led programming that invests in youth 14-23 seeking to transition from vulnerable mental, physical, financial and social health into thriving individuals and effective leaders and decision-makers. There are three main needs that Student Alliance Project addresses that must be addressed before a youth can achieve personal, educational and professional and leadership goals.\r\n\r\n1. Isolation, bullying and prejudice among vast numbers of youth and the lack of safe spaces where diverse youth can develop sustained, reciprocal and personal relationships, work together, reduce inter-group conflict and become active allies to one another in schools, communities and public policy efforts. \r\n\r\n2. Lack of hope and sense of agency that leads to high drop-out rates, unemployment, substance abuse rates and rates of depression and anxiety, among other symptoms. When youth do not believe they have the power to set and achieve personal, educational, professional and leadership goals or have the support to get there, they likely won\u2019t. \r\n\r\n3. High rates of trauma due to war, domestic violence, gang violence and abuse leave youth with post-traumatic symptoms that impact the health and safety of their families, schools, employment and communities. Over 30% of Student Alliance Project youth report that they have experienced war, domestic violence, abuse or gang violence and this is likely underreported. \r\n\r\nOn a larger scale, in Oregon we see that leaders, whether elected officials, business executives or nonprofit directors and board members, are not representative of the true diversity of our communities, yet they make so many of the critical decisions for our increasingly multicultural population.  \r\n\r\nAt the root are economic, educational and institutional systems that reinforce inequality, racism, gender discrimination and the marginalization of youth with disabilities, formerly incarcerated youth, gang-affected youth, teen parents, undocumented youth and queer youth. We believe that their increased access to leadership is a systemic change, that the lack of emerging leaders from under-represented communities reinforces a socioeconomic and political system run by people of privilege, who in turn tend to make decisions that benefit the privileged. \r\n\r\nWe are establishing Momentum Alliance as a sustainable youth-led non-profit. Our \u201cStep Up, Step Back\u201d coaching model, where every leader within our organization is sharing their knowledge and coaching someone else in learning their skills, is engrained at every level of our organizational structure. This model is coupled with a transparent culture where everyone is involved in decision-making and everyone participates in sharing their personal story. Our model for youth leadership can be replicated by others seeking to diversify leadership. ",

    "narrative5": "In early 2013, Momentum Alliance (MA) advocated for passage of Tuition Equity in Oregon, with the specific intention of elevating the leadership and voices of undocumented youth.

After ten years of passionate work by allies, Tuition Equity was finally signed into law in Oregon.

    "narrative6": "At its core, Momentum Alliance is working towards addressing the oppression of underrepresented communities by supporting youth from underrepresented communities in gaining the opportunities, skills, and experience to become leaders who are truly representative of the communities we live in. Our two programs, Student Alliance Project (SAP) and Leveraging Momentum (LM) work towards systemic change that address racial inequity, amongst other issues, and give youth a place where they can share their stories, struggles and strengths, with the goal of building alliances and reducing prejudices. Momentum Alliance cultivates a culture of accepting youth, with all the identities we bring to the table, valuing our voice, and seeing ourselves as accomplished leaders capable of making decisions over the issues that impact our lives. \r\n\t\r\nStudent Alliance Project (SAP) is a youth-led program for youth ages 14-23. Within SAP, we break down walls between diverse youth, building confidence and sustained alliances; we set and reach our personal, educational, and professional goals with individualized coaching and Personal Development Plans; and we learn and practice leadership skills in real-life organizing efforts. To accomplish this, SAP provides Summer, Winter and Spring Break Leadership Camps, monthly \u201cWhat\u2019s SAppening\u201d Events and year-round individualized coaching. Youth Leaders organize and mobilize youth from their communities, and they plan, design, facilitate and evaluate camp activities, so that Camps are not only an opportunity for the participants, but are critical practical leadership opportunities for the organizers. \r\n\t\r\nLeveraging Momentum (LM) meets the needs that arose from SAP and other young organizers around the region. Many SAP Youth Leaders were ready to seek positions of leadership and decision-making in the community, whether on non-profit boards, grant-making committees, government task forces, elected offices or professional management. LM is a network of leaders under 30 seeking to diversify decision-makers in the public, private, and non-profit sectors; alter relations of power; and make systems more equitable and accessible. LM works towards this by supporting youth in setting and reaching their leadership goals through individualized coaching and trainings; matching youth with leadership opportunities; and organizing a network of 200 diverse youth across the region. \r\n\r\nWe also have found a critical niche for engaging and interactive youth-designed and led curricula, workshops and presentations, requested by youth organizations, conferences, schools, colleges, congregations and educators. We have also provided coaching to leaders working in other youth-led organizations like Somali Youth of Oregon, Oregon DreamActivist and OPAL.

I was gang-affected and undocumented and they motivated me to make a difference, by making a film that helped people start conversations about LGBTQ and undocumented youth and how these movements connect. We established Momentum Alliance so we could keep building these alliances and continue to mentor future social justice leaders and decision-makers.\u201d \r\n\r\n- Cesar, 21, Momentum Alliance Founding Board Member\r\n\r\nI am from what they label the \u201cghetto\u201d\r\nI am from worrying if my mother is going to get caught by ICE\r\nI am from worrying about gang violence\r\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m not: I\u2019m not a statistic.\r\n\r\n-Vanessa, 18, Momentum Alliance Youth Director\r\n\r\nWe believe that one of the key reasons our country has made gains toward a Comprehensive Immigration Reform is the work of young, immigrant youth and the movement we helped propel since the Senate failed to pass the DREAM Act in December 2010. We believe that the determination and courage of undocumented youth nationally to come out, uncertain of the consequences and usually against the advice of the more established immigration organizations and helped change the conversation and the political environment.\r\n\r\nWe found that our role was sometimes to be a thorn in the side of the CIR organizations working with established organizations in the system. We told our stories, we rallied, we committed civil disobedience. As a result, after repeatedly saying there was nothing he could do, the President passed the Executive Action which is DACA.  \r\n\r\nThe momentum grew in Oregon and many organizations worked to pass Tuition Equity after 10 years and to bring back a form of Driver\u2019s Licenses for undocumented Oregonians (though not an equivalent license).\r\n\r\nWe believe that whether or not current CIR bills pass or fail, nothing can now halt the extraordinary activism of undocumented youth and their families. Once a group of marginalized people have raised expectations of progress, allies who will back them up and the power to believe they can achieve their goals they cannot be stopped.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t endorse or oppose any legislation at this point. Our goals are to continue our work so that:\r\n\r\n1. Undocumented youth and their peers understand the process, politics and progress around these bills and statewide measures.\r\n2. Undocumented youth continue to serve in leadership roles in and outside our organization, including advocacy and protest as they choose.\r\n3. Undocumented youth in our organization continue to inspire other underrepresented youth to speak up and find allies.",

    "narrative1": "Before 1996, repressive tactics by immigration officials and local police discouraged day laborers from seeking work at 3 major intersections in Portland, OR. Day laborers began to organize and found they shared common incidences of exploitation, wage theft, and homelessness. In 1998 the Day Laborer Project, a project of the Workers\u2019 Organizing Committee, formed. Through strategic grassroots organizing and advocacy efforts, the Day Laborer Project successfully ended all I.C.E. raids on these intersections and began reclaiming stolen wages. The success of the Day Laborer Project grew into Voz Workers\u2019 Rights Education Project (Voz) in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 the Martin Luther King Jr. Worker Center finally opened which offers a safe space for workers to find work, build community, increase their employability, and grow as community leaders.\r\n\r\nVoz Major Accomplishments:\r\n1. Reclaimed more than $350,000 in wages since 2000.\r\n2. Generated over 16,000 jobs since 2008.\r\n3. Decreased the collaboration between Police and ICE in Multnomah County with ACT Network, building more trust and safety in our communities.\r\n\r\nInterfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice (IMIrJ) is an interfaith coalition of individuals, faith leaders and congregations responding actively and publicly to the struggles of our immigrant brothers and sisters residing in the United States. We are committed to working for a just and humane immigration reform, and the transformation of the social and economic systems that perpetuate the poverty and in immigrants\u2019 home countries that drives much of the migration to the U.S.\r\n\r\nIMIrJ\u2019s major accomplishments this past year:\r\n1. Ending Police/ICE Collaboration: Through our community organizing efforts, we were successful in getting the Sheriff's office to change policy to not honor ICE holds in some situations.\r\n2.

On the street, day laborers face exploitation, homelessness, and wage theft. Immigrants in general, face multiple human rights abuses, weak wage theft protections, have no vote, and are often denied services despite paying taxes. Many immigrants (some of whom are day laborers) migrate here to escape political persecution and/or economic injustice caused by globalization and US foreign and trade policies. Frustration with the high unemployment rate in Oregon is often directed at immigrants, particularly those who fit a stereotype of \u201cillegal.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur work is tied to national and global struggles for human rights and a just society. Immigration is a truly global issue.Voz and IMIrJ are dedicated to achieving justice for all immigrants, and because of this we must challenge racism, classism, and nativism as a crucial element of our work. At Voz, we encourage day labor and immigrant organizers to think critically about how their local efforts connect to broader struggles so that they are strengthened by the power and solidarity of the global movement. This knowledge emboldens our leaders, giving them confidence to believe in their ability to affect true social change. IMIrJ focuses on work in areas where we can have an impact: in education, accompaniment and policy change and build collective power is by using already organized congregations.\r\n\r\nWe, VOZ and IMIrJ, seek to empower workers to defend themselves by uniting and working together. VOZ and IMIrJ aim to build collective power by collaborating together to educate, inspire, and activate immigrants/day laborers and faith leaders in faith-based organizations to organize around issues that affect immigrants. Issues such as: stopping police-ICE collaboration, protecting day labor worker centers, and immigration reform.\r\n\r\nVOZ and IMIrJ will work together to (1) unite targeted faith communities to the issues of the day laborer community, (2) activate Latino and immigrant faith leaders/members to organize around immigrant rights issues, (3) build a sustainable faith and day laborer leadership alliance for immigrant rights, (4) and to ultimately create a powerful voice to influence decision makers in the city, county, and federal level in support of immigrant rights.\r\n\r\nThough immigrants don't have the power to vote, our organizing plan aims to empower immigrant leaders to use their stories to mobilize their friends, family members, and faith organizations to pressure city government to find a permanent worker center for day laborers, pass stronger wage theft laws, stop police-ICE collaborations, and pass a \u2018humane\u2019 federal immigration reform.

    "narrative5": "Voz is a founding group member of the Safe Communities Project founded in 2010, charged with ending Police/ICE Collaborations in Multnomah County. This project became the Activists Coming Together for Justice and Dignity Network, or, ACT Network in 2011. Voz is a leader in the network because we ensure those directly affected by Police/I.C.E. Collaborations are at the table with decision makers, including Multnomah County Sheriff Dan Staton, County Chair Jeff Cogen, and other county commissioners. IMIrJ is an active member in the ACT Network, helping to connect the faith community to the issues led by the ACT Network. We strategically planned and coordinated press conferences, rallies, and actions within each of our constituencies that proved successful in decreasing Police/ICE collaboration in Multnomah County. This victory has strengthened our network and engaged day laborers and members of IMIrJ more than ever before in their communities. Our ultimate goal in this network is to end all Police collaboration with ICE. Voz and IMIrJ hope to build power in Latino congregations and other faith organizations to pressure the city and county to stop Police/I.C.E collaboration.\r\nBoth Voz and IMIrJ are both leaders in the coalition to Stop Wage Theft Now! in Oregon. We have consistently brought faith community and day laborer voices to the capital to change wage theft policies. The progress the coalition has made towards educating legislators about the realities workers face regarding wage theft would not have happened without Voz\u2019s connection with the day laborer community.

    "narrative6": "Voz and IMIrJ are committed to an inclusive process that secures the rights and empowerment of all Portland\u2019s immigrants, including day laborers. When we are educating allies and the broader Portland community about struggles, we integrate our analysis about how inequality and oppression play out in the immigration debate. The international labor movement especially compliments racial justice movements because all immigrants come from varying cultures, geographic regions, economies, education levels, and health circumstances that are directly correlated with race.\r\nThe vast majority of day laborers are men, and while we work to protect immigrant rights, we also dismantle sexism in our work and among those we organize. Voz works with the Latino Sexual Health Coalition who has provided our staff with trainings that confront hetero-normative stereotypes, and various stigmas relating to gender and sexuality. A statement of equity and safety is prominently reiterated by board members in the center and trainings curriculum include a mandatory workshop specifically devoted to gender justice. The popular education techniques used to run all meetings, workshops and assemblies enable inclusion from all who are present so that we can continue to combine our racial justice work with our economic justice work. Facilitators ensure that the ground rules for meetings and workshops foster respect for differences and the inclusion of underrepresented communities.\r\nThough IMIrJ is a faith based organization that is mostly comprised of white individuals and first- and second-generation immigrants, they work to educate and mobilize faith leaders to causes by immigrant-led organizations like VOZ in Wage theft and Police/I.C.E collaborations. IMIrJ in their collaboration with VOZ will aim to continue to organize the core base of faith congregations, and with the help of Voz organizers and their tools in popular education, will work to activate and mobilize Latino faith leaders (clergy and non-clergy) and Latino based congregations in the Portland area into the immigrant rights movement and bring new leadership to transform IMIrJ. Beyond collaborations with immigrant rights organizations such as Voz, IMIrJ\u2019s Board established a strategic intent to directly address the issues of racism and oppression. IMIrJ\u2019s first action in this was to hold a workshop design to have courageous dialogues about racism, sexism, and other oppression issues. ",

    "cycle_question": "Voz is currently developing a position on immigration reform bills being considered in Congress. At the moment, Voz in partnership with our national partner National Day Labor Organizing Network recognize that the immigration reform bills do not make it easy for day laborers to find a path to citizenship. We are also dismayed that there is a strong focus on the militarization of the border. Voz will continue continue to get the voice of the day labor community to our Oregon Delegates and seek to improve provisions and wording to be more inclusive of the needs of day laborers. In the meantime, Voz believes it\u2019s advocacy work in ending Police/ICE collaborations and Ending Wage theft create a momentum for pro-immigration reform that\u2019s just and humane for the immigrant and day labor community seeking a path for citizenship.\r\n\r\nInterfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice (IMIrJ) is still developing a position on immigration reform but believes that immigration reform legislation in the US must honor and respect all people by including a path to citizenship without unreasonable requirements and waits, supporting family unity and integration, protecting the human rights of workers and all people living in the US, and employing a humane enforcement strategy. Any reform that doesn\u2019t include a path to citizenship is unacceptable. While immigration reform is being considered, IMIrJ call for an immediate halt to all detentions and deportations because these actions criminalize immigrants and separate families. However, IMIrJ finds it troubling that the Senate Bill 744 would not provide all undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship, the fees involved in the application process would be exorbitant, the employment provisions are strict and limiting, and the border would be excessively militarized.\r\n\r\nWith immigration reform progressing in the Senate and House, Voz and IMIrJ are utilizing the momentum to develop and strengthen leadership in the day labor and faith communities, strengthen Alliances with organizations, engage with new communities to build power and strengthen the immigrant voice in the faith community in order to advocate for improvements in any legislation being considered. Our actions are will enable long-term relationship building. Our long term vision is to create a strong coalition of communities that can help educate and process immigrants for citizenship in the Portland area. We believe that activating Latino congregations and Latino leaders into the immigrant rights movement, prepares the path for the vision and possibility.\r\n\r\nIn the Portland area, the Latino/Hispanic population is 9.4% of the community or 54, 800 people. Around the Portland area, and with neighboring counties like Washington county (11.17% Latino population, of 49,744), Portland could see a very big need for the immigrant community being educated on the contents of immigration reform and the legalization process set in place by whatever the final form of federal immigration reform, and ability to be processed. Though the Latino community is spread out across the region, seeing densities in certain regions, we see that congregations can play a role in doing significant outreach, education, and mobilization.

    "narrative3": "David Anitok immigrated to Oregon from the Marshall Islands, a member of the Compact of Free Association States (COFA). COFA residents may live and work in the United States legally in exchange for US military interests. However, when David arrived here, he was unable to obtain a full driver\u2019s license because his community had slipped through the cracks in the driver\u2019s license law. It was not until his community became organized and advocated for access to full drivers licenses that this loophole was closed. Pacific Islanders are Oregon\u2019s fastest growing demographic and face the highest rates of poverty in the state at 45%. This is because COFA residents face barriers and lack of eligibility to many public services due to their non-citizen legal resident status.  \r\n\r\nThe issues facing Pacific Islanders reflects the challenges facing the greater API immigrant community in Oregon. API are under-represented in civic engagement, policy advocacy, and leadership development. Theories such as the model minority stereotype promotes the notion that we are all experience prosperity when the facts demonstrate persistent disparities. Anti-immigrant racism and barriers to public institutions and benefits have a significant impact particularly on newcomer immigrants and refugees who experience higher rates of poverty and lack of education.\r\n\r\nThe lack of economic justice, racial inequities in public policy and historic attitudes and beliefs of racial superiority are the root causes for disparities.  These are exacerbated by token civic engagement and insufficient leadership development structures.  We understand oppressions to be linked, including racism and xenophobia which deeply impact our community and intersecting with all forms of oppression such as heterosexism, ageism, ableism. \r\n\r\nAPANO works to identify and address the disparities that impact our communities through community organizing, leadership development and grassroots advocacy.  We believe that by building a strong coalition of API communities, we will be successful in our mission of social justice.   Our current programs are:\r\n\r\nEducation Equity: advocated for a Vietnamese immersion program to help close achievement gaps.\r\n\r\nHealth Equity: advancing policy change to improve data collection and expand access to health care. \r\n\r\nEconomic Justice: We are creating a sense of place for our communities in the 82nd Ave area without the negative effects of gentrification and displacement.\r\n\r\nLeadership Development: Our Leadership Institute selects an annual cohort who leave the program ready to advocate for their communities.\r\n\r\nCivic Engagement: APANO aims to serve as a HUB for API organizations across Oregon to support broad based, ethnic/language specific, voter engagement efforts.  \r\n\r\nThe impact of our work is more engaged API communities who have better access to justice including the ability to drive to work, better access to primary and higher education, and not only the right to medical care, but culturally competent medical care. \r\n\r\n",

    "narrative4": "After some organizational soul searching, APANO has reached a point where we understand we need to deepen our analysis around LGBTQ, the undocumented, and youth in general. The API community first needs a chance for community to come together and heal. We believe that working on the issue of immigration reform is not only about the greater political campaign, but that when undocumented API speak out, this strengthens the whole movement. \r\n\r\nThe focus of our workplan is to share stories, develop an understanding for the size of the community, and most importantly, understanding that storytelling can be a political act. The role for APANO in the greater movement is to provide safe space for storytelling and for coming to terms with being undocumented. There is also a significant intersection of queer and undocumented API and we particularly want to reach out to this community.\r\n\r\nOur strategy would would be to host a series of group listening circles as well as a number of 1 on 1 discussions. One track would be to hold group and individual discussions with young people. This will provide them with a space to share in a comfortable setting. This not only would advance the movement, but also inform and facilitate our greater youth organizing. We would also host a series of listening circles and 1 on 1s with API adults in their native language. While many undocumented youth grow up in this country and speak English, we also need to reach their parents and elders who may be undocumented and really hear their experiences as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Hispanic community should not be the primary voice for immigration reform. We would like to add culturally specific API conversations and advocacy to the movement. By identifying undocumented advocates, we can develop our voice.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Strong relationships are the foundation for meaningful change. Our experiences as Asians and Pacific Islanders inspire our partnerships with each other and promote our coalition building in order to find solutions to shared concerns. APANO values partnership and is an active partner and regular thought leader with the Micronesian Islander Community of Oregon (MIC) and the Oregon Health Equity Alliance (OHEA) among a larger base of organizations.\r\n\r\nMIC is organized exclusively for charitable, educational purpose and to promote cultural awareness programs and events that provide social needs, economic growth and justice to Micronesian communities among Oregon. APANO has been a supporter to MIC since its inception and has been involved with collaborating on legislative days and provided leadership training to MIC members. We seek to continue to assist MIC and other Pacific Islander community organizations build their capacity for social change work.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon Health Equity Alliance formalizes cross-sector partnerships to provide statewide leadership for policy change that improves the health outcomes. OHEA utilizes a social determinants of health framework, and primarily works on issues with statewide impact. In the 2013 session, OHEA has prioritized and led efforts for upstream health issues including restoration of driver license for undocumented immigrants, tuition equity, and direct health policy issues of cultural competency for licensed health professionals, uniform data collection of race, ethnicity and language, and full prenatal care for undocumented women. This partnership supports our mission to improve health outcomes for the API community.\r\nIn these collaborations, we provide a strong leadership presence as well as some financial and training support. These collaborations strengthen our collective voice and while coalition partners may be identity based versus issue based, they build a broader and more unified progressive moment by taking advantage of synergies in advocating for policy change and magnifying each organizations' reach.\r\n\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "We envision a just and equitable world where Asians and Pacific Islanders are fully engaged in the social, economic and political issues that affect us. The root causes of inequities are connected and shape our social justice and human rights work. We stand in solidarity with other communities who experience oppression.\r\n\r\nAPANO's Board adopted a new strategic plan in late 2012 that centers our strategic focus on increasing racial equity particularly in health and education systems, and further defined our analysis and framework of racial justice and community organizing. In 2013, we have worked successfully to pass Oregon's first cultural competency for health care professionals bill and a legislation establishing uniform data collection of race, ethnicity, language and disability for health and human services. Both of these issues have been prioritized through APANO's community driven strategic planning process that engaged over 200 members. These bills improve accessibility and better statistical information to address the needs of our diverse communities.\r\n\r\nA concrete example of our ongoing connecting between different forms of oppression is our leadership in the Racial Equity Report Card (RERC). The RERC is a 2 year old collaboration of leading social and racial justice organizations that issues a legislative report card, a multi-issue and multiracial assessment of the legislative session, evaluating lawmakers commitment to advancing opportunity and closing disparities affecting Oregonians, particularly Oregonians of Color. 2011 was the first year of the project, and the report card achieved high visibility with over a dozen media hits, led to foundational analysis of racial equity in public policy for lawmakers and their staff, and has sustained dialogue with electeds and leadership led by communities of color, immigrants and refugees. APANO serves on the leadership working group alongside Basic Rights Education Fund, Causa Oregon, Center for Intercultural Organizing, Partnership for Safety and Justice, Urban League of Portland, and Western States Center, and co-convene an advisory group of over 25 labor, faith and community organizations. APANO has led fundraising efforts to build the capacity of working group members to deepen their engagement in the project, and has benefited from ongoing working relationships with BRO\u2019s Racial Justice Alliance Building Project and PSJ\u2019s Criminal Justice Reform efforts.\r\n\r\n",

Before we can focus on this broader campaign, we would like to use the current momentum to first better understand our communities, where their support networks are, how large the undocumented community is, and to collect stories. We understand that undocumented API often enter our borders legally and that many of our youth do not even realize they are undocumented until much later in life due to the stigma around it. We do not see CIR as the be all end all of the movement. The community organizing we plan to do really addresses the broader issues facing the API community and will not predominantly focus on policy reform at its onset. \r\n\r\nWe already work heavily with immigrant communities in our economic justice and education equity work. For example, we worked with the immigrant Vietnamese community this year to convince the Portland school district to create a Vietnamese immersion program to help close achievement gaps. These connections and trust can be leveraged to do effective grassroots organizing around immigration. We would use this opportunity to expand our analysis within our organization and help develop out our youth and queer API programs. There are so many intersections across issues we would like to incorporate across our work.\r\n\r\nAs API identify as undocumented, we believe this will strengthen the whole movement and add to the collection voices speaking out on the issue. Our role is to facilitate culturally specific and language specific places for API to come together and form communities. Once we have developed API leaders, we will be more effective partners in the greater immigration reform movement. ",

The purpose and results in the Northwest Detention Center was three-fold: The collaboration facilitated first hand testimony from Circle participants of what happens inside the detention center. Developed and distributed brochures in Spanish to alert immigrants of their rights, and IPJC filed shareholder resolution with the GEO group that run the Detention Center. \r\n2. IPJC partnered with both Northwest Immigrant Rights Project Granger and Northwest Justice Project Yakima to facilitate two Leadership Development Interactive Workshops in Spanish in Eastern Washington. The partnership raised awareness on issues that concerned the Latino community; responded to a direct need for skill building workshops in Spanish; connect them to existing resources not known by the majority of workshops attendees; and engaged them to take action.\r\nWe are one of handful of organizations are working state-wide and cross multiple issues facing Latinos.

    "narrative6": "First, our organizational Board is primarily white. Therefore we recently created a hybrid Executive Board. Board make up is over 50% low-income women 70% of whom are women of color. Organizationally, we have multiple programs and projects that address the interdependent issues of economic disparity, oppression, racism, sexism and homophobia. For instance in our Justice for Women project, low-income and women of color collaborate with economically stable partners, to identify root causes, organize and specifically act to affect systemic changes through legislation and/or change the condition that negatively affect their lives. These grassroots led Circles are multi-racial and multi-class in nature and in the past, have addressed varied justice issues such as increasing state funding for services for immigrants, healthcare, homeless and improving transportation system for the marginalized population. \r\nAn example of ally collaboration is with the  Seattle Human Rights commission, where for 2 years we advocated for the enactment of the Seattle City Council Job Assistance Bill, which provides job assistance for individuals with criminal history. Given the overwhelmingly disproportional incarceration of people of color, this legislation therefore provides second chance at economic independence to a greater extent to minority groups.  In another Justice Circle in Sunnyside, we advocated for and were successful at instituting a bilingual Board meetings and Latina Women board members. We also collaborated with other religious leaders to advocate for Marriage equality legislation.  Other ways in which racial inequality is addressed is \r\nStaffing for Justice for Women done by the project coordinator and 2012 Human Rights Institute Fellow, Giselle Carcamo MSW, a Latino immigrant.

We want to ensure our community is informed and ready to take action when a loved one is being detained by police or ICE. We will have campaigns to put pressure on the local jails to drop an ICE hold when someone is in jail.  Then if whoever is arrested ends up in a detention center we will put pressure to stop the deportation by calling our local ICE offices and DC ICE.  \r\n\r\nOur work will focus in building deportation defense strategies within the community, by organizing, educating and empowering the undocumented communities.  We want to make sure our community knows what to do when a loved one is picked up by ICE or if a loved one is facing deportation.  \r\n\r\nThe root causes of migration is economic displacement caused by multi-national free trade agreements. The unrestricted flow of capital and goods has pushed our families (specifically) in Mexico into deep poverty which causes families to migrate to the U.S. as economic refugees. The root causes of deportations is our broken immigration system.  Our government has failed millions of undocumented immigrants by not granting us a humane immigration reform with a quick path to citizenship.  Our current government puts people in detention centers, taxes them, and allows private detention centers to profit from their suffering and from family separation.   Our undocumented community is being attacked and dehumanized because of their status.  Corporations are allowed to cross borders but people are not allowed to cross borders.  \r\n\r\nOur collective power is built by empowering our community members.  Doing workshops to teach our undocumented community how to stop ICE holds and deportations by making calls to their local jails, local ICE office, and DC ICE, by asking their local elected officials to support their loved ones who are in deportation proceedings and setting up petitions to make sure we draw attention to the injustices our communities are facing.  \r\n\r\nAs undocumented immigrants we have been told to be silent about our status, to fear the police and ICE, to let our allies do the work for us and to speak for us because it is too risky to fight for our community ourselves.  We want to make sure our community feels empowered and to make sure they lose the fear of breaking the silence. \r\n\r\nOur work will help end the fear created by ICE within the undocumented community, by empowering our community with knowledge about their rights, and the strength of their collective power.  \r\n\r\nWe can\u2019t continue to wait for Obama or CIR to save us, we will have to save ourselves.

    "cycle_question": "Colectiva Legal del Pueblo is made up of people who are directly affected by the CIR bill.  As a collective, we are against the current CIR bill, because it will continue to criminalize our immigrant communities.  The language of the bill will make it more difficult for people who have criminal records to adjust status and will also create more barriers for people who are arrested in the future. We understand that many immigrants may get caught up in the criminal system because of economic pressures, racial profiling or simply poor choices. There will likely be harsher criminal and immigration consequences for immigrants after CIR. However, we do not believe there should be a two-tiered criminal justice system simply because of one's immigration status. \r\n\r\nThe current CIR bill has a focus on enforcement and militarization of the border.  Billions of dollars will be added to the militarization of the border and many more hundreds of people will be killed or jailed just because they come to the U.S. to seek economic refugee from conditions in their home country. Conditions that the U.S. most likely had a contributing role, such as NAFTA or military invasions. Enforcement through ICE will also be more stringent and more families will continue to be ripped apart.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, many people will not be able to benefit from the bill, because of the bill\u2019s restrictions and numerous fees.  We calculate that under the current CIR Bill, a person will have to pay well over $2,500 dollars in application fee and fines. However, of the 11 million undocumented people currently in the U.S., only 4-5 million will qualify for a path to citizenship. We also do not agree with the proposal to do away with the family visa system which would eliminate the option of siblings and extended family applying for status. Instead, the visa system will be focused on high-skilled labor and formal education determined by a point system. This type of visa system will perpetuate economic injustice because people will not have the mobility to migrate because of their socio-economic position. We would like to see a more humane CIR bill with less focus in enforcement and more focus on family reunification, and a path to citizenship.  The current CIR bill does not address anti-immigrant programs like Secure communities, 287g, and ICE holds.  ",

That day, nine leaders of community-based, Latino-led social change organizations in the Mid-Willamette Valley\u2014the \u201cCAPACES network\u201d\u2014signed and filed the articles of incorporation.

We organized and conducted some 200 meetings and gatherings, large and small\u2014cross training on the practicalities of leadership and the big ideas of social change.  In 2008, we concluded that we must accelerate and deepen the leadership development.

This despite the fact that Latinos make up the majority of the population in Woodburn, Oregon, and other segments of the Valley the CLI operates in. \r\n\r\nWe believe that under-representation leads to decisions that often don\u2019t reflect the needs of the community, such as laws that fail to protect farmworkers in the state and federal level, a broken immigration system that separates families, unequal allocation of resources, city ordinances that fail to pave the roads of Latino dense neighborhoods, etc. \r\n\r\nRoot causes\r\n\r\nSome of the primary root causes of these problems include: lack of/in-access to (higher) education, due to one\u2019s lower-income status and/or barriers due to immigration status; and a Lack of trust/confidence in the political process, which may stem from lack of knowledge or from years of perceived injustice in the allocation of resources and prejudices in laws that becomes reinforced year after year.\r\n\r\nThis coupled by a deficit of leaders that are representative of the community, are capable, driven, and principled to make decisions in the political realm makes it that much more difficult to make lasting change. Even more, these same root causes often creates a similar deficit of leaders in the social justice movement. \r\n\r\nBuilding collective power\r\n\r\nWe build collective power by forming a coalition between sister organizations, such as CAUSA Oregon or PCUN (Oregon\u2019s farmworker union), and capture the history and experiences to create a popular education curriculum that can benefit future leaders. We organize university faculty members across the state, and key strategic leaders who have powerful ideas and expertise that can help us form innovative programs.\r\n\r\nAddressing the root causes\r\n\r\nOur leadership curriculum may not change the root causes of under-representation, but it works to address the \u2018deficit of leaders. One of the tools we use in CAPACES Leadership Institute is popular education, often described as education for critical consciousness, which has Latin America traditions that often targeted low-income and marginalized communities. The concept: rather than have top-down teaching such as teacher-pupil, we have peer-to-peer teaching initiated by a facilitator. The premise: that no matter what occupation, income bracket, and level of formal education, everyone can participate and contribute by drawing upon their life experience or through engaging activities described as dinamicas. Popular education makes information more accessible for those with barriers to formal education.\r\n\r\nThe CLI currently offeres CAPACES 101 (our history and principles) and Fundraising 101 (fundraising principles) for emerging leaders. We are developing higher courses of leadership development, one of which will include \"People's Representative\" for those seeking an elected position.",

The CLI has also established a committee, composed mostly of board members and board alternates, expressly to guide the planning, evaluation of CLI programs, participation levels and program impacts. Additionally, the CLI\u201ds \u201ccouncil of advisors\u201d composed of 61 allies in non-profit training institutions and academic institutions whose work has intersected with immigration and immigrant communities, will serve as the projects external advisory group.", 
    "narrative5": "The CAPACES Leadership Institute collaborates with nine different sister organizations that tackle issues such as Education reform (Salem Keizer Coalition for Equality), Immigrant rights (Causa Oregon), Women empowerment (Mujeres Luchardores Progresistas), and farmworker justice (PCUN), to name a few.\r\n\u2022\tOne specific collaboration we recently had between these different organizations was we organized a regularly planned event we call \u201cMass Gatherings\u201d where we unite the leaders, organizers, and volunteers of our nine sister organizations. An example of a past mass gathering topic was a 2-part discussion on Homophobia. The first class focused on the roots of homophobia, as the second class addressed LGBTQ terminology and how we can be better allies to combat homophobia with the families and communities we organize in. These mass gatherings allow us to be knowledgeable to the issues that impact our community but also the broader community. It helps make our CAPACES Network movement more knowledgeable and understanding to the needs of the broader progressive community.\r\n\r\nAnother collaboration we've had was Green Hammer, a Portland based design-build firm leading in sustainable building practices and architects. We collaborated to build the leadership institute (construction completed last August) in Passive House technology. Dylan Lamar from greenhammer described passive house as: \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced building energy-efficiency standard and it centers around three simple principles: insulation, air-tightness, and heat-recovery ventilation.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn our collaboration with greenhammer we also organized events with the central theme \"What do Green Cards have to do with the green movement\", connecting the green movement or architects with the brown (Latino-immigrant right's) movement who have green cards (legal residency). This collaboration created an opportunity to connect two movements that rarely have opportunities to interact in a dialogue. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "The CAPACES Leadership Institute addresses inequality, oppression and discrimination through its five-part \u201cCAPACES 101\u201d classes which explore the different \u201cisms\u201d such as: racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, as well as homophobia. The class is taught through a \u201cpopular education\u201d format which draws from the experiences of the class participants utilizing a class facilitator who digs deep into those experiences. Discussions tend to challenge participants own prejudices as they explore experiences outside of their own.\r\n\r\nThe CAPACES 101 class on \u201cisms\u201d also puts an emphasis in analyzing the differences between personal prejudice and institutional discrimination. This analysis equips class participants with the tools to distinguish what forms of inequality or discrimination lie in the category of personal prejudice and institutional discrimination, which is important for young and old organizers to be able to identify correctly to effectively organize against some of the \u201cisms\u201d in the community. \r\n\r\nThe class participants of CAPACES 101 tend to be young and old organizers and volunteers in the CAPACES Network composed of nine different organizations who in their own work promote racial justice whether it is women\u2019s rights, education reform, or immigrant rights. Most of the class participants come from Latino-immigrant background. \r\n",

Our hereditary chief is 91 years old, and represents an unbroken line of chiefs from pre-contact times.

Our tribal council are all direct descendants of the last two Clatsop Chiefs, Tostom and Coboway. We have one motive, and one motive only in seeking restoration, and that is to honor our ancestors who lived and died to keep our culture alive.  We signed a treaty presented to us by the US Government in 1851, which was not ratified.  In 1954, the Western Oregon Termination Act, terminated the rights of Western Oregon Tribes, and we were included in the list of those tribes.  Since then seven tribes have been restored by Congress, and now our tribes seeks to restore our status of a Federally recognized tribe.  When our homelands were taken over, we gathered in a small town, subjected to atrocities of white settlers, then later the kukluxklan.  People still build their homes over the graves of our ancestors to this day.  We are not \"eligible\" to have our relics returned to us because we are not federally recognized.  Our Major accomplishment is that we are still alive, organized now, still fighting for justice.  Other accomplishments are that we continue to work on cultural preservation  We have a cedar canoe and travel in the Canoe Journeys of the northwest, sharing our tribal songs, dances and culture.  We've also published two history books, and have a video about our people that runs every day at the Lewis and Clark National Historical Parks.  Our children remember who they are.   ",

We continue to live our lives here as a community even though we do not have sovereign rights with the United States Government as recognized Tribal governments do.  Without any rights, settlers were given free reign over our homelands.  We were forced to either move away, or move inward to a small town where even there we suffered humiliating racist acts.   We signed a treaty, which was not ratified.  Even though we were not given a treaty, we were again named in a congressional act which officially terminated us in 1954.  At this point we have no land we call our own.  Even our ancestral relics, and remains of our ancestors located in the National Archives will not be returned to us because we have no rights.  We can not even protect our grave sites where people build their homes.  The only way to protect ourselves is to gain rights as a restored tribe.  We have organized ourselves as a collective group meeting officially monthly, but more often than that to achieve restoration.  With no money, we have been able to make contact and gain the support of an ex-congress woman that assisted the other tribes gain restoration.  We have gathered information on how to accomplish our goal, created a commission to work on all the details required by the Congress to establish our restoration.  We have also established a relationship with our current congressional representative and will be asking her to present a bill in the current congress.  We have created relationships with other tribes and non-Indian local governments and organizations who now support our endeavor.  When our Bill is approved, we will have been restored, establishing our sovereign rights as Indian people in the United States of America.  With these rights, we will have the right to bring our ancestors home from the National Archives, and build a formal Government, which will have the status of a Tribal Government to US Government Relationship.

GJL has grown into an active membership base of over 50 trans* people and their allies who strive \u201cto fight oppression based on gender and sexuality in Washington State and to create a community where trans* people can live their lives safely, true to themselves, and free from discrimination.\u201d GJL empowers trans* activists to make positive social change in their communities through democratic decision making that prioritizes education, leadership development, and grassroots organizing. \r\n\r\nDespite its short history, GJL has the organizational capacity and skilled membership necessary to implement effective programming and events. As the organization has taken shape over the last eight months and started to build its base, GJL\u2019s members have laid out an ambitious agenda. To date, GJL has worked with Gender Odyssey to provide trans* sensitivity training in area schools and collaborated with the People of Color Against AIDS Network to address the alarming rates of HIV in the trans* community. GJL has also provided trainings to 15 other social service agencies, government agencies, and medical providers. Moving forward, public events such as Trans* Pride and Trans* Town Hall will become annual events in the community. \r\n\r\nAn important area of policy currently being driven by GJL members is the removal of trans* healthcare exclusions on a state-wide level. GJL is leading a coalition of LGBTQ groups, including Basic Rights Oregon whose advocacy secured trans*-inclusive healthcare in Oregon, to lay the groundwork on this issue and to see it through to its passage.\r\n\r\nThis diverse mix of public events, small group trainings, policy advocacy, and internal empowerment work represents the essence of GJL and its future.

    "narrative3": "Trans* activists formed GJL to increase the capacity to address the root causes of transphobia and homophobia that trans* people face on a daily basis. The gender binary, which dictates that people must meet certain definitions of masculinity or femininity, is the primary source of transphobia and is enforced through both subtle and violent means. Rigid adherence to the gender binary in institutions such as schools, hospitals, housing assistance programs, prisons, and government agencies significantly affects those who cannot change their legal identification or safely access public or private spaces that are segregated by gender. Often times trans* people are not able to obtain proper identification, access public bathrooms safely, secure employment, or even find safe housing as homeless shelters are frequently segregated by gender and are notorious for sexual violence committed against trans* people. This gendered form of control is mediated by trans* peoples' intersecting identities, such as their race, ability, age, and class. The inability to seamlessly access societal institutions due to their gender identity and expression significantly impacts trans* peoples' life outcomes, leading to increased poverty, criminalization, and discrimination.\r\n\r\nAs reported by the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS), trans* people are twice as likely to be unemployed as non-trans people and 90% report being harassed and discriminated against on the job. Due to these challenges in the workforce, trans* people are four times more likely to live in extreme poverty with an annual income of less than ten thousand dollars and often engage in sex work and other activities in the survival economy to make ends meet. This economic marginalization and social stigma takes a devastating toll on the community: 41% of trans* people surveyed reported having attempted suicide, 25 times the national average.  GJL believes that these sobering statistics are reflective of the conditions of local trans* communities. Preliminary results from focus groups sampling the Seattle trans* population reflect this immense social and economic inequality highlighted in the NTDS.\r\n\r\nTo address these root causes, GJL mobilizes on multiple levels, including the individual, collective, and systemic levels. On an individual level, GJL empowers trans* people to build the critical analysis, self-care skills, and self-confidence necessary to love themselves, a radical act in a transphobic society. Organizationally, GJL recognizes that power is built from the bottom-up, not top-down. Members of GJL develop a shared theory of change that addresses the root causes of transphobia and prioritizes community organizing and mobilization as a part of a broader social movement to dismantle systems of oppression. This political framework is useful for identifying institutional targets of trans* activism, such as state healthcare laws that discriminate against trans* people in Washington.\r\n",

    "narrative4": "As a relatively new organization, GJL is in its community building stage. With a solid base of over 50 members, GJL is engaging in ongoing recruitment, especially of trans* people of color and low-income trans* people. With significant organizational momentum going into Trans* Pride in June, GJL hopes to increase its visibility and dig deeper into issues the trans community is passionate about. \r\n\r\nWith an increased public profile, GJL will host a Trans* Town Hall in August. This event will be a panel discussion with a diverse array of trans* activists and the audience engaging in dialogue about the history of the trans community, its present conditions, and its future, concluding with action steps to address community problems. \r\n\r\nFollowing a busy summer with a significant public presence, GJL will focus on internal work through the Trans* Leadership Retreat, a forum for sharpening the skills of existing leaders and training new activists. The retreat will be led by outside facilitators facilitating an anti-oppression curriculum.\r\n\r\nIn the next six to twelve months, GJL hopes to further expand its reach on a state-wide level. Talks between multiple organizations have begun about organizing an advocacy day in Olympia in early 2014. Furthermore, current high-level strategy sessions being led by GJL regarding the removal of trans* health care exclusions in Washington will hopefully blossom into public advocacy within a year, at which point GJL will focus on mobilizing the trans* community for the policy's passage.\r\n\r\nGJL is intensely reflective and self-critical in the evaluation of its work. Benchmarks for meeting our goals include calculating any increase in membership, determining the effectiveness of leaders, assessing GJL's public profile and visibility, and tracking significant victories on important issues. This data collection and analysis will be led by GJL's data expert, a trans-identified Masters in Social Work student.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "GJL's goal is to be a powerful force in the growth of a social justice movement for trans* people through community building, education, leadership development, and advocacy. GJL attempts to do this work in a cross-movement and intersectional approach that recognizes the multiple identities and experiences of each trans* person. Centering the need for collaboration as a key step toward building a broad-based social change movement, GJL has worked with groups to attempt to remove healthcare exclusions for trans* people in Washington and has supported economic justice through a statement from LGBTQ Allyship signed by multiple organizations, including GJL.\r\n\r\nGJL is now leading a state-wide effort to remove healthcare exclusions for trans* people by working with the ACLU, Legal Voice, Equal Rights Washington, Ingersoll Gender Center, and other activists in the LGBTQ community. These high-level talks about strategy will later evolve into mobilization to pressure the legislature to enact this policy change. With collaboration between a diverse set of leaders and with significant organizational backing, GJL believes that trans health care exclusions can be outlawed in our state.\r\n\r\nGJL has also collaborated with LGBTQ Allyship to support economic justice. Recently LGBTQ Allyship circulated a petition to urge the Space Needle to fly the Pride flag in June and to demand the negotiation of a fair union contract with its employees that includes a living wage, meaningful benefits, job security, and stronger anti-discrimination policies. Ten groups, including GJL, banded together to submit this statement to the owners of the Space Needle, an action supported by the Seattle LGBT Commission. Only with such strong community support in solidarity with Space Needle workers will the owners be forced to negotiate a fair contract. \r\n\r\nThese collaborations represent starting points toward uniting a diversity of communities into a broad social movement seeking justice for all.", 
    "narrative6": "As a primarily white-led organization with multiracial membership, GJL actively engages in ally work to fight racism in solidarity with organizations led and consisting primarily of people of color. As a part of our theory of change, GJL recognizes that racism is deeply rooted in this country's history and must be actively dismantled. GJL seeks to create an anti-racist community that is both striving individually and evolving collectively to support each other by building the strong personal relationships and human connections that are the source of undoing oppression.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with our values of anti-racism work and collaboration, GJL has collaborated with the People of Color Against AIDS Network (POCAAN) to do cross trainings on anti-racism work and trans* cultural competency. This relationship between GJL and POCAAN is an accessible means toward the goal of increasing access to HIV testing for trans* people of color, white trans* people, and non-trans* people of color. By including Gay City Health Project as well, the goal is to form a coordinated program between the three agencies to increase access to HIV testing for the populations we work with, all of whom are at high risk for AIDS/HIV. This program would also act as a gateway to HIV vaccination clinical trials at the University of Washington for the trans* community and communities of color, led by Ro Yoon, a GJL member who is a trans-identified woman of color.\r\n\r\nThe work being done by GJL and POCAAN takes place at the intersection of trans* and racial justice by recognizing that both the trans* community and people of color are at  significantly greater risk for HIV infection than the general population. For example, trans* women are almost 50 times more likely to be infected by HIV according to a study done by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Similarly, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the African American community faces rates of HIV infection that are almost 10 times higher than the infection rate among whites. For trans* women of color the HIV infection rates are higher still. This shared and overlapping community-wide vulnerability paves the road for a natural collaboration between GJL and POCAAN.\r\n\r\nGJL's work with POCAAN is a concrete example of the intersectional approach that is central to our work. GJL hopes to form more natural alliances with groups of color on issues such as the staggering rate of unemployment, discrimination in the workplace, inadequate access to safe and affordable housing, skyrocketing incarceration rates, the criminalization of immigration, and the ability to access affordable health care, all issues that disproportionately affect people of color, the trans* community, and trans* people of color in particular. \r\n",

    "narrative3": "The need for leadership/community development in Idaho is crucial.  Approximately 11% of Idaho\u2019s populations are women of color (WOC); however, only two women of color serve in the Idaho legislature, including one of WOCA\u2019s founding mothers, elected in November, 2010.  Women of color, particularly Hispanic/Latina and Native American women are much more likely to live in poverty in Idaho than Idaho white women.  The education level and average annual wages are significantly lower for WOC than the general population, made worse by Idaho\u2019s rural landscape.  In contrast, WOCA\u2019s Board of Directors is comprised 100% of women of color.  Women obtain valuable training and support in identifying and challenging oppression resulting from racism, sexism and economic injustice.  WOC now serve in public office, start their own businesses, and strengthen their families and communities by making safer, healthier choices for themselves with support from various training programs.  \r\nOur goal is to maintain our strong presence in Idaho; Women and people of color look to us for leadership and yes defiance.  We continue to move forward with a limited budget and no staff, but yet we persevere. In 2010, Idaho\u2019s Women\u2019s Network closed their doors after 20 years, their finally plea to seek public financial support fell on deaf ears, WOCA\u2019s leadership addressed the importance of IWN\u2019s existence in the media and made its final plea to keep IWN\u2019s doors open.  Today, WOCA is the only women\u2019s political organization that addresses race and gender, and maintains a working and positive relationship with the tribal women leadership from Coeur d\u2019Alene, Kootenai, Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock, and Shoshone-Paiute. WOCA\u2019s ability to create film and put a face and voice to the past actions of this state toward communities of color have ignited statewide conversations often lead by Native women.  WOCA maintains its history and leadership as the only organization to create film and continued opened dialogue.  Through this network, we empower ourselves and provide the tools to face the challenges we meet in everyday life. Our strong and creative leadership, provides workshops and trainings that give women the skills they need to run or support women running for office, and cultivate independence and to address the lack of representation within the existing power structure in Idaho.

    "narrative1": "ROP\u2019s greatest accomplishment has been building a progressive movement in rural Oregon. Our progressive movement is based on inclusion, human rights, and participatory democracy, with the human dignity group (HDG) as its basic structure.  Our success is in the development and maintenance of local pro-justice organizations that allow small town Oregonians to demand true democracy and dignity, and to challenge white supremacy, bigotry, and anti-democratic policies at every turn to transform the culture of rural Oregon in a way that ripples from the local outward to the state and federal.  \r\n\r\nAs of 2013 we work with 51 member HDGs, representing 29 of Oregon\u2019s 36 counties.  ROP, the catalyst and link between each group, fosters structural and analytical capacity to build power over the long haul.  Started by and for rural people, we drafted a mission that looked at the weapons of race, class, and gender oppression and how they were used to divide neighbors against each other.  \r\n\r\nSince 1992, ROP\u2019s mission has been \u201cto strengthen the skills, resources and vision of primary leadership in local, autonomous human dignity groups (HDGs) across the state with the goal of keeping such groups a vibrant source for a just democracy.\u201d  ROP\u2019s mission stems from our conviction that the way to shift the balance of power towards justice is through grassroots, collective, strategic action. \r\n\r\nOur overarching successes of the past 19 years include:\r\n\u2022\timpacting politics in Oregon so rural voices are at the progressive table\r\n\u2022\tcreating and sustaining a coordinated infrastructure for progressive organizing in rural Oregon that includes over 50 groups and thousands of human dignity activists\r\n\u2022\tmaintaining a broad analysis over the past decade that has expanded from our roots in the queer rights struggle to include immigrant rights, anti-war/anti-imperialism, tax fairness, funding for human needs, economic justice, choice, and environmental justice\r\n",

    "narrative3": "ROP\u2019s seeks to put rural communities at the center of the fight for economic justice with an aspirational view of the small town \u201cCommons.\u201d We use the phrase \u201cCommons\u201d to refer to public infrastructure like schools, libraries, and post offices, but also the viability of small town economies and basic community needs like social services, immigrant services, housing, and health care.\r\n\r\nROP began in the early 1990s as a \u201cFight the Right\u201d organization.  In 1992, the Right was using culture wars and wedge strategies to divide our communities and gain power. In 2013, the face of the Right in small town Oregon can be seen through Tea Party takeovers of local government, anti-immigrant rhetoric, \u201castroturf\u201d organizing to advance a neo-liberal, corporate economic agenda, and the further dismantling of public infrastructure, like the postal service and public schools.\r\n\r\nThe Citizens United ruling that corporations are people, bombardment with unlimited campaign spending in the 2012 Election, dismantling of the United States Postal Service (USPS), attempts to destabilize public unions, Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr.\u2019s statement that the Justice Department may not pursue criminal cases against big banks because it could destabilize the economy\u2026these are all symptoms of a long term agenda for corporate dominance of our politics, economy, and democracy.\r\n\r\nRural Oregon is on the front lines of the fallout and can be on the front lines of the struggle to redefine our economy.  ROP builds power by mobilizing dozens of human dignity groups and small town communities to push back with our own vision of economic justice and fairness. One example is our work with leaders in Oregon\u2019s smallest communities to defend small town Post Offices.\r\n\r\nThe Right has an anti-government, anti-worker agenda, and a multi-decade plan for eliminating our public postal service \u2013 and other public infrastructure \u2013 for privatization and corporate gain.  If successful, they would take down the 2nd largest employer in the country (after Walmart).  This is a public employer where 85% of staff have collective bargaining, 40% are women, 40% are people of color and 22% are veterans. Rural post offices are also crucial for the survival of small town communities.  \r\n\r\nROP\u2019s organizing uses rural post office organizing as a wedge against this corporate agenda from a very unanticipated constituency \u2013 the most rural towns in the state. Our small town post office work highlights the economic needs of the small communities and showcases the enormous mobilization power and impact of these same towns. In total, we reached out to 140 communities.  51 of those communities held local campaign activities \u2013 a huge and powerful base to mobilize for the next phase of ROP\u2019s small town economic justice organizing against corporate dominance.\r\n",

For example organized resistance to debt (1 in 10 mortgages have been in foreclosure at one time in some rural Oregon counties, and up to 20% of credit card debt is currently delinquent), and fighting resource extraction projects that risk environmental devastation, health impacts, and loss of identity in rural Oregon towns.\r\n\r\nROP will use three types of convenings to develop campaign plans:\r\no\tRural Caucus & Strategy Session: statewide convening of over 125 ROP/HDG leaders\r\no\tIn-community Living Room Conversations (LRCs): that deepen the connection between saving rural post offices, economic justice and Right-wing strategies to privatize our communities and defund government.  LRCs build analysis and develop local human dignity group economic justice organizing campaigns that respond to the opportunities and challenges of their particular community.  \r\no\tRegional Convenings that bring together HDGs from across the region to build relationships and develop shared strategy\r\n\r\nOur goal is to engage over 500 people in our convenings and work with 12 communities on local economic justice organizing campaigns.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "ROP believes in building an all-inclusive movement where personal relationships, shared struggle, and strategic collaboration build a shared agenda and bigger impact.  The following are several of the most significant collaborations for ROP.\r\n\r\nROP is a founding board member of Causa Immigrant Rights Organization and continues today on the board of directors.  We have a long-term relationship with Basic Rights Oregon.  These relationships allows deep partnerships that anticipate the use of wedges to divide identity groups and more creative, cooperative responses that magnify our collective strength.  For example, when ROP\u2019s hometown was challenged in 2008/2009 with two countywide anti-immigrant ballot measures, BRO and Causa stepped in dedicating huge resources, staff time, and campaign leadership to partner with ROP, eventually defeating both measures.  ROP has worked with BRO on the Our Towns campaign building towards a marriage equality ballot measure.  This spring, we partnered with Causa in coordinating the March for ONE Oregon that brought a 50-passenger bus on a 5 day trip through of Eastern Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, promoting immigration reform in key Congressional Districts.\r\n\r\nAnother collaboration is among organizations committed to preventing Wage Theft in Oregon.  The original members of the coalition are NW Workers Justice Project, PCUN, Oregon Center for Public Policy, Voz, and ROP.  That coalition has grown to over 20 groups and is currently working on legislation in the Oregon Legislature and educating workers on their rights.\r\n\r\nIn addition ROP is an active member of ACT for Justice and Dignity, a network of groups fighting police/ICE collaboration, and with the Rights Working Group.  All of these relationships ensure that ROP\u2019s rural strategies are in line with state and national goals to win victories for immigrants, LGBTQ people, and low-income people in Oregon and across the country.\r\n", 
    "narrative6": "While our base has historically been representative of the whitest areas of a state in one of the whitest regions in the country, ROP has created a culture that prioritizes racial justice work and the leadership of organizations of color within the state.  We have developed strategic allied relationships with organizations of color in Oregon, such as CAUSA, PCUN, UNETE, Voz, Center for Intercultural Organizing, and APANO that create accountable and coordinated racial justice work.  Our current work builds on both our strong history of prioritizing racial justice, as well as our historic relationships with CAUSA and PCUN.\r\n\r\nIn the past 4-5 years, our work has begun to incorporate more direct organizing among immigrants and people of color, especially Latinos, in rural Oregon   We have coordinated efforts with our friends at CAUSA and PCUN, and built a Latino organizing program that prioritizes leadership development of rural Latinos and integration of those leaders into ROP\u2019s infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nIn 2008 we hired a bilingual, bicultural staff person with experience organizing rural Latinos.  In 2011 we hired one of the leaders from our Latino Advisory Board. Our number of Latino-led human dignity groups has grown to 6 and ROP hosted our second annual Latino Leadership Retreat in March, 2012 with over 50 participants.  ROP has built a Latino Advisory Board (LAB), and that committee now has two members who cross-over with the Board of Directors.  LAB is playing a key role in our current Strategic Planning process.\r\n\r\nWe have welcomed this internal shift in our membership and leadership, and have dedicated real resources towards not only recruiting and developing leaders of color, but also towards the internal organizational work with our current majority white board, staff and membership.  Through our yearlong strategic planning process, which will conclude in 2013, we have taken time as an organization to delve into potential obstacles and make a plan for how to move to the next organizational phase as a multi-cultural organization.  First steps include incorporating racial justice language into our mission, vision, values statement, formalizing the leadership role of LAB in our organization, recruiting more Latino leaders for a stronger presence on our board, and a dismantling racism workshop that will take place on June 9th with our board, staff, and several dozen key ROP members.  We will continue to flesh out a plan that allows us to do our work engaging white people in racial justice (which has been held up as a national model, including in Chris Crass\u2019 new book \u201cTowards Collective Liberation: Anti-Racist Organizing, Feminist Praxis, and Movement Building Strategy\u201d), as we expand our base to include the growing rural Latino population.\r\n",

    "narrative3": "In Oregon we see that leaders, whether elected officials, business executives or nonprofit directors and board members, are not representative of the true diversity of our communities, yet they make so many of the critical decisions for our increasingly multicultural population. \r\n\r\nFrom the demand we have had from underrepresented youth, it is clear there are not enough youth-led opportunities for youth from underrepresented communities to gain hands-on organizing and leadership skills, practice them in tangible ways and get individualized support and coaching needed to address the multiple barriers they face so that they can reach their personal, educational, and professional goals, and become the leaders our communities need.\r\n\r\nAt the root are economic, educational and institutional systems that reinforce inequality, racism, gender discrimination and the marginalization of youth with disabilities, formerly incarcerated youth, gang-affected youth, teen parents, undocumented youth and queer youth. We believe that their increased access to leadership is a systemic change, that the lack of emerging leaders from under-represented communities reinforces a socioeconomic and political system run by people of privilege, who in turn tend to make decisions that benefit the privileged. \r\n\r\nMomentum Alliance is the only youth-designed and -led organization we know of that supports youth to achieve success, with the ultimate goal of preparing new leaders. We work to connect youth leaders across movements, geography and backgrounds and to serve as a launching pad for youth to become the next leaders in the social justice movements they care most about. We have demonstrated that with the necessary funding, coaching and curricula, it is possible to assist youth in transitioning from vulnerable mental, physical, financial and social health to becoming thriving individuals and effective leaders. Most importantly, we believe it is other youth who have faced similar obstacles and achieved their goals who are best suited to inspire and engage their peers. \r\n\r\n\u201cMomentum Alliance provided the opportunity for me to come out as undocumented and helped me start my own business. MA flew me to Atlanta to meet with other national undocumented youth leaders. I came back motivated to cofound Oregon DreamActivist. I now realize that I am an immigrant rights leader who can influence public policy and mobilize community members at the local, state and national levels.\u201d -Jaime, 27\r\n\r\nWe aim to demonstrate Momentum Alliance as a sustainable youth-led non-profit. Our \u201cStep Up, Step Back\u201d coaching model, where every leader within our organization is sharing their knowledge and coaching someone else in learning their skills, is engrained at every level of our organizational structure. This model is coupled with a transparent culture where everyone is involved in decision-making and participates in sharing their personal story. \r\n",

    "narrative4": "As Momentum Alliance, our overall goals and strategies for the coming year include\tsuccessfully carrying out our two major programs, Student Alliance Project and Leveraging Momentum. \r\n\r\nStudent Alliance Project (SAP) is a youth-led program for youth ages 14-23. Within SAP, we break down walls between diverse youth, building confidence and sustained alliances; we set and reach our personal, educational, and professional goals with individualized coaching and Personal Development Plans; and we learn and practice leadership skills in real-life organizing efforts. To accomplish this, SAP provides Summer, Winter and Spring Break Leadership Camps, monthly \u201cWhat\u2019s SAppening\u201d Events and year-round individualized coaching. Youth Leaders organize and mobilize youth from their communities, and they plan, design, facilitate and evaluate camp activities, so that Camps are not only an opportunity for the participants, but are critical practical leadership opportunities for the organizers. \r\n\t\r\nLeveraging Momentum (LM) meets the needs that arose from SAP and other young organizers around the region. Many SAP Youth Leaders were ready to seek positions of leadership and decision-making in the community, whether on non-profit boards, grant-making committees, government task forces, elected offices or professional management. LM is a network of leaders under 30 seeking to diversify decision-makers in the public, private, and non-profit sectors; alter relations of power; and make systems more equitable and accessible. LM works towards this by supporting youth in setting and reaching their leadership goals through individualized coaching and trainings; matching youth with leadership opportunities; and organizing a network of 200 diverse youth across the region. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation and strateginc plans we have developed with independent evaluators for both SAP and LM will help us determine if we have met our goals and objectives as well as let us know where we can improve on our work and where we are doing things well and efficiently.\r\n", 
    "narrative5": "Our origins in the \u201cPapers\u201d film project and our non-profit model are built on intersectional and inter-movement alliances. The \u201cPapers\u201d documentary film project was a critical tool in connecting the immigrant rights and LGBTQ movements, garnering grants from Arcus Foundation and the Evelyn & Walter J. Haas Jr. Fund to do just that. Our ethics as an organization and our mission are focused on building alliances among and between individuals and movements in a genuine and sustainable way.\r\n\r\nFor example, MA Leaders, both undocumented and documented, Latino, African American, Jewish and Muslim, partnered with Oregon DreamActivist, an undocumented-led organization, and held regular meetings with undocumented young people in the majority. Undocumented youth developed a one-pager for the TE Coalition around preferred messaging. They also designed posters and social media images to align with this messaging. After ten years of passionate work by allies, Tuition Equity was finally signed into law in Oregon. This was the first time undocumented youth were in the legislative strategy and organizing meetings, ensuring their best interests were being met in the process. Post-session, we created a video about the work, which can be found at http://www.momentumalliance.org. \r\n\r\nMA programs are about partnership and collaboration, whether it is LM staff member, Laquisha Minnieweather working with Alex Horsey from Project Believe in Me, a youth-led anti-bullying initiative, to design and facilitate a workshop at the Oregon Queer Youth Summit or co-founder Jaime Limon Guzman providing peer coaching to youth organizer Nicole Johnson from Organizing People Activating Leaders (OPAL) to build her campaign skills to ensure youth continue to have access to public transportation through Youth Pass. Jaime has provided Nicole with peer coaching on recruitment, preparing testimony and testifying. \r\n", 
    "narrative6": "You can simply see by the youth who participate in our programs, that we make connections between individual and oppressions and struggles for social justice. It is inherent in our work and our purpose for existing. We are undocumented, immigrant, indigenous, LGBTQ, gang-affected, HIV positive and low-income youth, youth of color, youth with disabilities, youth transitioning from foster care, homelessness and incarceration, youth who have experienced domestic violence and abuse, teen parents and allies. We represent six religions.\r\n\r\nYou can see it in our workshops which include:\r\n\u201cGot Your Back: How Muslim, LGBTQ, Undocumented, Gang-affected Youth and Youth with Disabilities Have Become Friends and Allies.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhy Aren\u2019t They Listening? Building More Effective Youth/Adult Partnerships\u201d \r\n\r\nYou can see it in our advocacy efforts. Youth Organizers practiced advocacy and wrote and gave testimony in front of Metro Regional Government and the Oregon State Legislature on Tuition Equity for undocumented students. They are learning about efforts to stop police profiling and increase police accountability, reform the criminal justice system and prevent bullying. \r\n\r\nYou can see it in the new outrage that has emerged from truly knowing others who are different from oneself, not in a \u201cdiversity training,\u201d but in hands-on, day-to-day relationship building activities. Two Youth Organizers, one who attends Special Ed and the other who attends General Ed at Summer Camp and discovered they went to the same school but had never seen one another and began to see the inequities in their educational experiences. They decided to go back to school to try to break down the isolation between General Ed students and SPED students. Because we believe relationships are the first point of community organizing, they hosted a SAP bowling trip for students in both their peer groups to get to know one another. \r\n\r\nYou can see by our partners and those referring youth to us and seeking our services. Some partners have included: Linfield College, Lewis and Clark\u2019s Center for Career Engagement, Winningmark, Portland State University, staff from Evergreen and Vancouver school districts, City of Portland\u2019s Future Connect and Ride Connection. Our camps have had referrals from DHS, County Court Advocates, Outside In, Independent Living Program for foster youth in Clackamas, and Clackamas County Bridges to Housing for youth transitioning from homelessness. We work with many schools to outreach. We are regularly contacted by organizations seeking partnerships, consulting or services including PolitiCorps, Project Unify, Lamda Legal Defense Fund and others.\r\n\r\nOur organization is led by people of color.
